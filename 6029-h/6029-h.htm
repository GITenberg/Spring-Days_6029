    <h2>
      PREFACE
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Henry Vizetelly, that admirable scholar, historian, and journalist,
      was sent to prison for publishing Zola's novels mine were taken over by
      Walter Scott, and all were reprinted except &ldquo;Spring Days.&rdquo; This book was
      omitted from the list of my acknowledged works, for public and private
      criticism had shown it no mercy; and I had lost faith in it. All the
      welcome it had gotten were a few contemptuous paragraphs scattered through
      the Press, and an insolent article in <i>The Academy</i>, which I did not
      see, but of which I was notified by a friend in the Strand at the corner
      of Wellington Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was the article a long one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don't think they thought your book worth slashing. All I can tell
      you is that if any book of mine had been spoken of in that way I should
      never write another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I left my friend, hoping that the number of <i>The Academy</i> would not
      fall into the hands of the editor of the great London review, to whom I
      had dedicated the book after a night spent listening to him quoting from
      the classics, Greek, English, and Latin. &ldquo;A very poor testimony, one which
      he won't thank me for,&rdquo; I muttered, and stopped before St. Clement Danes
      to think what kind of letter he would write to me. But he did not even
      acknowledge through his secretary the copy I sent to him, and I accepted
      the rebuff without resentment, arguing that the fault was mine. &ldquo;The
      proofs should have been submitted to him, but the printers were calling
      for them! There's no going back; the mischief is done,&rdquo; and I waited,
      putting my trust in time, which blots out all unfortunate things, &ldquo;even
      dedications,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three months later, on opening my door one day, I found him standing with
      a common friend on the landing. I remember wondering what his reason was
      for bringing the friend, whether he had come as a sort of chaperon or
      witness. He left us after a few minutes, and I sat watching the great man
      of my imagination, asking myself if he were going to speak of &ldquo;Spring
      Days,&rdquo; hoping that he would avoid the painful subject. The plot and the
      characters of my new book might please him. If he would only allow me to
      speak about it he might be persuaded to accept a second dedication as some
      atonement for the first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were kind enough to dedicate your novel&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Spring Days'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, 'Spring Days.' I know that you wished to pay me a compliment, and if
      I didn't write before it was because&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it so very bad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A butty little man raised Oriental eyes and square hands in protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have written other books,&rdquo; he said, and proposed that we should go
      out together and walk in the Strand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, 'The Confessions of a Young Man' was much liked here and in France.
      Will you let me give it to you?&rdquo; We stopped at a book shop. &ldquo;It will
      please you and help you to forget 'Spring Days.'&rdquo; He smiled. &ldquo;Never
      mention that book again,&rdquo; I added. &ldquo;I wonder how I could have written it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We were in a hansom; he turned his head and looked at me without
      attempting to answer my question; and from that day till six months ago my
      impulse was to destroy every copy that came my way. A copy of &ldquo;Spring
      Days&rdquo; excited in me an uncontrollable desire of theft, and whenever I
      caught sight of one in a friend's house I put it in my pocket without
      giving a thought to the inconvenience that the larceny might cause; the
      Thames received it, and I returned home congratulating myself that there
      was one copy less in the world of &ldquo;Spring Days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the Boer War drove me out of London I said: &ldquo;Dublin doesn't contain a
      copy of that book;&rdquo; and for nearly eight years I was left in peace, only
      Edward Martyn teasing me, saying that one of these days he must read the
      book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;R&mdash;&mdash; always says, 'I like &ldquo;Spring Days&rdquo;.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Insolent little ass,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;I'll cut him dead when we meet again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Edward was not joking as I thought he was, and some time afterwards he
      told me that after a good deal of advertising he had succeeded in
      obtaining a copy of &ldquo;Spring Days.&rdquo; The moment he left the room I searched
      the table and bookcase for it, but he kept it at Tillyra, else it would
      have gone into the Liffey, which receives all things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear George, I like the book better than any of your novels,&rdquo; he said
      one day on his return from Galway. &ldquo;It is the most original, it is like no
      other novel, and that is why people didn't understand it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of course it was impossible to quarrel with dear Edward, but I wondered if
      I ever should find pleasure in speaking to him again; and when A. E. told
      me a few weeks later that he had come upon a novel of mine which he had
      never read before&mdash;&ldquo;Spring Days,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Edward gave it to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I haven't seen him for many months.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The worst book I ever wrote.&rdquo; A. E. did not answer. &ldquo;What do you think of
      it?&rdquo; To my surprise I found him of the same opinion as Edward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear A. E., you know how I rely on your judgment. For twenty-five
      years I have refused to allow this book to be reprinted. Shall I relent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A. E. did not seem to think the book unworthy of me, and pressed me to
      read it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll lend you my copy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I received it next day, but returned it to him unread, my courage having
      failed me at the last moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few months later I met Richard Best, one of the librarians at the
      National Library. He had just returned from his holidays; he had been
      spending them in Wales for the sake of the language.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I came across an old novel of yours&mdash;'Spring
      Days.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn't like it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, I liked it as well, if not better, than any novel you
      have written. It is so entirely original. My wife... I think you value her
      opinion&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She liked it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come home with me, and she'll tell you how it struck her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will, on one condition, that you don't mention that you spoke to me
      about the book.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Best promised, and we had not been many minutes in the house before Mrs.
      Best interrupted my remarks about the weather to tell me what she thought
      of &ldquo;Spring Days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The matter is important. Sooner or later I shall have to think about a
      collected edition. Is it to be included?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Best, like A. E., offered to lend me her copy, but I could not bring
      myself to accept it, and escaped from the book till I came to live in
      London. Then Fate thrust it into my hands, the means employed being a
      woman to whom I had written for &ldquo;Impressions and Opinions.&rdquo; She had lost
      her copy; there was, however, an old book of mine which she had never
      heard me speak of&mdash;&ldquo;Spring Days&rdquo;&mdash;and which, etc., she was
      sending me the book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Omens are omens,&rdquo; I muttered, &ldquo;and there's no use kicking against the
      pricks eternally;&rdquo; and cutting the string of the parcel I sat down to read
      a novel which I had kept so resolutely out of my mind for twenty-five
      years, that all I remembered of its story and characters was an old
      gentleman who lived in a suburb, and whose daughters were a great source
      of trouble to him. I met the style of the narrative as I might that of an
      original writer whose works I was unacquainted with. There was a zest in
      it, and I read on and on; I must have read for nearly two hours, which is
      a long read for me, laying the book aside from time to time, so that I
      might reflect at my ease on the tenacity with which it had clung to
      existence. Every effort had been made to drown it; again and again it had
      been flung into the river, literally and metaphorically, but it had
      managed to swim ashore like a cat. It would seem that some books have nine
      hundred and ninety and nine lives, and God knows how long my meditation
      might have lasted if the front door bell had not rung.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you at home, sir, to Mr.&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There is time for one word more, dear reader, and whilst my visitor lays
      his hat and coat on the table in the passage I will beseech you not to
      look forward to a sentimental story; &ldquo;Spring Days&rdquo; is as free from
      sentiment or morals as Daphnis and Chloe.

    <h2>
      I
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss, I'll have his blood; I will, miss, I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For goodness' sake, cook, go back to your kitchen; put that dreadful pair
      of boots under your apron.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, miss; I'll be revenged. He has insulted me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can't be revenged now, cook; you see he has shut himself in; you had
      better go back to your kitchen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The groom, who was washing the carriage, stood, mop in hand, grinning,
      appreciating the discomfiture of the coachman, who was paying the penalty
      of his joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cook, if you don't go back to your kitchen instantly, I'll give you
      notice. It is shameful&mdash;think what a scandal you are making in the
      stable-yard. Go back to your kitchen&mdash;I order you. It is half-past
      six, go and attend to your master's dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has insulted me, he has insulted me. I'll have your blood!&rdquo; she cried,
      battering at the door. The rattling of chains was heard as the horses
      turned their heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put those boots under your apron, cook; go back to your kitchen, do as I
      tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman retreated, Maggie following. At intervals there were stoppages,
      and cook re-stated her desire to have the coachman's blood. Maggie did not
      attempt to argue with her, but sternly repeated her order to go back to
      her kitchen, and to conceal the old boots under her apron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What business had he to rummage in my box, interfering with my things; he
      put them all along the kitchen table; he did it because I told you, miss,
      that he was carrying on with the kitchenmaid. He goes with her every
      evening into the wood shed, and a married man, too! I wouldn't be his poor
      wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go back to your kitchen, cook; do as I tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With muttered threats cook entered the house, and commanded the
      kitchenmaid to interfere no more with the oven, but to attend to her
      saucepans.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a violent woman,&rdquo; thought Maggie, &ldquo;horrid woman. I am sure she's
      Irish. I'll get rid of her as soon as I can. The place is filthy, but I
      daren't speak to her now. She's stirring the saucepan with her finger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment quick steps were heard coming down the corridor, and Sally
      entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cook, cook, I want you to put back the dinner half an hour. I have to go
      down the town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Sally, I beg of you, what will father say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father isn't everybody. I daresay the train will be a little late; it
      often is. He won't know anything about it, that is if you don't tell him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want to go down the town for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never you mind. I don't ask you what you do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want to go down the slonk,&rdquo; whispered Maggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cook stopped stirring the saucepan, and the kitchenmaid stood
      listening greedily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing of the kind,&rdquo; Sally answered defiantly. &ldquo;You're always trying to
      get up something against me. Cook, will you keep back the dinner twenty
      minutes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cook, I forbid you. I'm mistress here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How dare you insult me before the servants! Grace is mistress here, if it
      comes to that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grace has given me over the housekeeping. I am mistress when she is too
      unwell to attend to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing of the sort. Grace is the eldest, I would give way to her, but
      I'm not going to give way to you. Cook, the dinner won't be ready for
      another half hour, will it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know when the dinner will be ready, and I don't care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a quarter to seven now, dinner won't be ready before seven, will
      it, cook? Keep it back a bit. Now I must be off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, as Maggie expected, Sally ran past the glass houses and the pear and
      apple trees, for there was at the end of the vegetable garden a door in
      the brick wall that enclosed the manor house. It was used by the
      gardeners, and it communicated with a path leading through some corn and
      grass land to the high road. There were five acres of land attached to the
      manor house, tennis lawn, shady walks, flower garden, kitchen garden,
      stables, and coach house at the back, and all this spoke in somewhat
      glaring fashion the wealth and ease of a rich city merchant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There she goes,&rdquo; thought Maggie, flaunting her head. &ldquo;What a fool she is
      to bully father instead of humouring him. We shall never hear the end of
      this. His dinner put back so that she may continue her flirtation with
      Meason! I shall have to tell the truth. Why should I tell a lie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please, miss,&rdquo; said the butler as Maggie passed through the baize door,
      &ldquo;I think it right to tell you about cook. We find it very hard to put up
      with her in the servants' hall. She is a very violent-tempered woman; nor
      can I say much for her in other respects. Last week she sold twenty pounds
      of dripping, and it wasn't all dripping, miss, it was for the most part
      butter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John, I really can't listen to any more stories about cook. Has the
      quarter-to-seven come in yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't seen it pass, miss, but I saw Mr. Willy coming up the drive a
      minute ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Willy entered, and she turned to him and said: &ldquo;Where have you been to,
      Willy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brighton. Has father come in yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. You came by the tramcar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With shoulders set well back and toes turned out, Willy came along the
      passage. His manner was full of deliberation, and he carried a small brown
      paper parcel under his arm as if it were a sword of state. Maggie followed
      him up the steep and vulgarly carpeted staircase that branched into the
      various passages forming the upper part of the house. Willy's room was
      precise and grave, and there everything was held under lock and key. He
      put the brown paper parcel on the table; he took off his coat and laid it
      on the bed, heaving, at the same time, a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you notice if the quarter-to-seven has been signalled?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but don't keep on worrying; the train is coming along the
      embankment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there will be a row to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sally told cook to keep the dinner back; she has gone down the slonk to
      speak to Meason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn't you tell cook that she must take her orders from you and no
      one else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I did, but Sally said I was no more mistress here than she was. I said
      Grace had given me charge of the house, when she could not attend to it;
      but Sally will listen to no one, she'll drive father out of his mind.
      There's no one he hates like the Measons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter with Grace? Where is she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's in her room, lying on the bed crying. She says she wants to die;
      she says that she doesn't care what becomes of her. She'll never care for
      another man, and father will not give his consent. What's-his-name has
      nothing&mdash;only a small allowance; he'll never have any more, he isn't
      a working man. I know father, he'll never hear of any one who is not a
      working man. I wish you'd speak to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've quite enough to do with my own affairs; I've had bad luck enough as
      it is, without running into new difficulties of my own accord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she refuses Berkins, father'll never get over it. I wish you would
      speak to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, don't ask me. I never meddle in other people's affairs. I've had
      trouble enough. Now I want to dress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Maggie went downstairs, she found her father in the drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The train was a little late to-night. Has Willy come back from Brighton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been looking over his accounts and I find he has lost nearly two
      thousand pounds in Bond Street, and I don't think he is doing any good
      with that agency in Brighton. I never approved of one or the other. I
      approve of nothing but legitimate city business. Shops in the West End!
      mere gambling. Where is Grace?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's in her room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In her room? I suppose she hasn't left it all day? This is very terrible.
      I don't know what to do with you. Since your poor mother died my life has
      been nothing but trouble and vexation. I can't manage you, you are too
      strong for me. So she hasn't left her room; crying her eyes out, because I
      won't consent to her marrying a penniless young officer! But I will not
      squander my money. I made it all myself, by my own industry, and I refuse
      to keep young fellows in idleness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't give you any trouble, father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are the best, Maggie, but you encourage your sister Sally. I hear
      that you, too, were seen walking with young Meason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not true, I assure you, father. I met him as I was going to the
      post-office. I said, 'How do you do?' and I passed on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Sally?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She went out a few minutes ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't she know the time? She ought to be dressing for dinner. Do you
      know where she's gone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think she went down the slonk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His children had inherited his straight, sharp features and his small,
      black, vivid eyes. Their hair was of various hues of black. Maggie's was
      raven black and glossy; Sally's was coarse and of a hue like black-lead;
      Grace's was abundant and relieved with sooty shades; Willy's hair was
      brown. He was the fair one of the family, and his hair was always closely
      cut in military fashion, and he wore a long flowing military moustache
      with a tinge of red in it. His father and he were built on the same lines&mdash;long,
      spare bodies, short necks and legs, and short, spare arms, and if the
      father's white hair were dyed the years that separated him from his son
      would disappear, for although the son had only just turned thirty, he was
      middle-aged in face and feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sally and Grace were both thickly built, the latter a little inclined to
      fat. Maggie was thin and elegantly angular, and often stood in picturesque
      attitudes; she stood in one now, with her hands linked behind her back,
      and she watched her father, and her look was subtle and insinuating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I came here,&rdquo; he said, speaking rapidly, and as if he were speaking
      to himself, &ldquo;the place was well enough; there was nothing but those
      wretched cottages facing the sea, the green, and a few cottages about it;
      but since those villas have been put up, Southwick has become unbearable.
      All my troubles,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;originated in the Southdown Road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maggie turned aside, smiled, and bit her lip; she did not speak, however,
      for she knew her father did not care to be interrupted in his musings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A hateful place&mdash;glass porticoes, and oleographs on the walls.&rdquo; Here
      Mr. Brookes stopped in his walk to admire one of his favourite Friths.
      &ldquo;Those ridiculous haberdashers, with a bas-relief of the founder of their
      house over the doorway. The proprietors of the baths, the Measons, poor as
      church mice, the son a mate of a merchant vessel&mdash;these are not
      proper associates for my daughters. I will not know them; I will not have
      them in my house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Measons are quite as good as we are, father. They may be poor, but as
      far as family goes&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are just the same as the others, Maggie; once there is a young man to
      flirt with, you don't care what he is or where he comes from. When there
      are no young men, you will snub the old ladies fast enough; and as for
      Sally, she is downright rude. I didn't want to see the haberdashers, but
      while they were in my house I was polite to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the Horlocks who told them to call.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it was. If Mrs. Horlock likes to know these people, let her know
      them; but what does she want to force them upon us for? That's what I want
      to know. We might never have known any one in the Southdown Road; I mean
      we never should, we never could have known any one in the Southdown Road
      if Mrs. Horlock hadn't come to live there. We had to call upon her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every Viceroy in India called upon her. She was the only woman whom every
      Viceroy did call upon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know she was. Of course we had to call upon her. Most interesting
      woman; the General is very nice, too. I like them exceedingly. I often go
      to see them, although the smell of that mastiff is more than I can bear in
      the hot weather, especially if lilies or strong smelling flowers are in
      the room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She feeds the mice, she won't let them be destroyed, she lets the traps
      down at night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't let us go into the animal question. The constant smell of dogs is
      unpleasant, but I could put up with it&mdash;what I can't stand are her
      acquaintances in the Southdown Road, and when I think that we should not
      have known any of them if it hadn't been for her! Indirectly&mdash;I do
      not say directly&mdash;she is the cause of all my difficulties. It was at
      her house Sally met young Meason; it was at her house Grace met that young
      officer for whom she is crying her eyes out; and it was at her house&mdash;yes,
      I hadn't thought of it before&mdash;it was at her house that Willy met
      that swindler who induced him to put two thousand pounds into the Bond
      Street shop. The Southdown Road might have remained here for the next five
      hundred years, and we should have known nothing of it had it not been for
      Mrs. Horlock; if she likes to know these people let her know them, but why
      force them upon us? It was only the other day she was talking to me about
      calling on some new friends of hers who have come to live there. I dare
      say it is the custom to call on every one at Calcutta, but I say that
      Calcutta etiquette is not Southwick etiquette, and I don't care how many
      Viceroys called upon her, I will not know the Southdown Road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The enunciation of this last sentence was deliberate and impassioned. Mr.
      Brookes walked twice across the room; then he stood, his hands crossed
      behind his back, looking at his admired Goodall. His anger melted, and he
      mused on the price he had paid, and the price he thought it was now worth.
      Fearing he would return to the Southdown Road trouble, Maggie said: &ldquo;I am
      afraid we shall be obliged to get rid of the new cook. She is Irish. Just
      before you came in I found her in the stable-yard threatening to break
      Holt's head with a pair of dreadful old boots.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want to hear about the cook. The money you spend in housekeeping
      is enormous. Since your poor mother died I haven't had a day's peace. If
      it isn't one thing it is another. You are fit for nothing but pleasure and
      flirtation; there isn't a young man in the place or within ten miles you
      haven't flirted with. I am often ashamed to look them in the face at the
      station. It is past seven; why isn't dinner ready?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sally told the cook to put the dinner back half an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sally told the cook to put my dinner back half an hour!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Brookes's face grew livid. The end of all things was at hand; his
      dinner had been put back half an hour! This was a climax in the affairs of
      his life, which for the moment he failed to grasp or estimate. Was a
      father ever cursed with such daughters as his? He had been in the City all
      day working for them; he did not marry because he wished to leave them his
      money, and this was the return they made to him. His dinner had been put
      back half an hour! Passion sustained him for a while; but he gave way,
      and, pulling out a silk handkerchief, he sank into a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't cry, father, don't cry. Sally is thoughtless; she didn't mean it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Brookes wept for a few minutes; Maggie strove to soothe him; he waved
      her away, he wiped his eyes and in a voice broken with anguish, &ldquo;Ah,
      well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I suppose it will be all the same a hundred years hence.&rdquo;
       In moments of extreme trouble he sought refuge in such philosophy, but now
      it seemed inadequate and superficial, and Maggie had begun to fear the
      violence of the storm she had brewed. She did not mind stimulating
      ill-feeling, but she did not wish Sally to provoke her father recklessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The possibility of his marrying again and having a second family was the
      one restraining influence Mr. Brookes still retained over his daughters,
      so Maggie, who was always keenly alive to the remotest consequences of her
      actions, took care that his home never became quite unbearable to him; and
      when Sally entered the room, dark and brilliant in red velvet, and in no
      way disposed to admit she had been guilty of heinous wrong in
      countermanding the dinner, Maggie attempted a gentle pouring of oil on the
      waters. But waving aside her sister's gentle interposition, she said: &ldquo;You
      mustn't think of yourself only, father. I admit I told the cook to put
      back the dinner a few minutes. What then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did it that you might finish your conversation with young Meason,&rdquo;
       said Mr. Brookes, but his words were weak, it being doubtful if even
      Meason could add to the original offence, so culminating and final did it
      seem to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maggie didn't tell you that last week she met him on the sea road, and
      walked with him into Portslade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, father, I beg of you, now, don't cry; think of the servants.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And it was in such unity of mind and feeling that this family sat down to
      dinner in the great dining-room, rich with all comforts and adorned with
      pictures by Frith and Goodall. Sally, who unfortunately knew no fear,
      talked defiantly; she addressed herself principally to her brother, and
      she questioned him persistently, although the replies she received were
      generally monosyllabic. As he chewed his meat with reflection and
      precaution, broke his bread with deliberate and well-defined movements,
      and filled his mouth with carefully chosen pieces, he gradually ventured
      to decide that he would not speak to his father that evening of the scheme
      he had been hatching for some months. It was one of his strictest rules
      not to think while eating, so it may be said that it was against his will
      that he arrived at this conclusion. Willy suffered from indigestion, and
      he knew that any exercise of the brain was most prejudicial at meal times.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner Mr. Brookes and his son retired to the billiard-room to
      smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your sisters are a great trouble to me&mdash;a very great anxiety. Since
      your poor mother died I've had no peace, none whatever. Poor Julia, she's
      gone; I shall never see her again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Willy made no answer. He was debating; he was still uncertain whether the
      present time could be considered a favourable one to introduce his scheme
      to his father's notice, and he had made up his mind that it was, when he
      was interrupted by Mr. Brookes, who had again lapsed into one of his
      semi-soliloquies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your sisters give me a great deal of trouble, a very great deal of
      anxiety. I am all alone. I have no one to help me since the death of your
      poor mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My sisters are fitted for nothing but pleasure,&rdquo; Willy replied severely.

      II
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Brookes went to London every day by the five minutes to ten; Willy
      walked into Brighton. There he had been for some time striving to found an
      agency for artificial manures, and in the twilight of a small office he
      brooded over the different means of making money that were open to him.
      The young ladies worked or played as it struck their fancy. Sally admitted
      that she infinitely preferred walking round the garden with a young man to
      doing wool-work in the drawing-room. Maggie shared this taste, although
      she did not make bold profession of it. Grace was the gentlest of the
      sisters, and had passed unnoticed until she had fallen in love with a
      penniless officer, and tortured her father with tears and haggard cheeks
      because he refused to supply her with money to keep a husband. The doctor
      had ordered her iron; she had been sent to London for a change, but
      neither remedy was of much avail, and when she returned home pale and
      melancholy she had not taken the keys from Maggie, but had allowed her to
      usurp her place inthe house. Sally was supposed to look after the
      conservatories, but beyond her own special flowers she left everything to
      the gardeners.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Sundays Mr. Brookes walked through the long drawing-rooms aimlessly.
      Sometimes he would stop before one of his pictures. &ldquo;There, that's a good
      picture, I paid a lot of money for it, I paid too much, mustn't do so
      again.&rdquo; Passing his daughters, sometimes without speaking, he then stopped
      before one of the big chimney-pieces, and, pulling out his large silk
      pocket handkerchief, dusted the massive clocks and candlesticks.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the billiard-room, at a table drawn up close to the coke fire, Willy
      slowly and with much care made pencil notes, which he slowly and with
      great solemnity copied into his diary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your sisters are a great source of trouble to me, a source of deep
      anxiety,&rdquo; said Mr. Brookes, and he flicked the rearing legs of a bronze
      horse with his handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My sisters are only fit for pleasure,&rdquo; said Willy and he finished the
      tail of the y, passed the blotting paper over, and prepared to begin a
      fresh paragraph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid Grace is scarcely any better; she will not leave her room. I
      hear she is crying. It is too ridiculous, too ridiculous. What she can see
      in that man I can't think; he is only a man of pleasure. I've told her so,
      but somehow she can't get to see why I will not settle money upon her&mdash;money
      that I made myself, by hard work, judicious investments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a smack at the shop,&rdquo; thought Willy, as he placed his full stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll not settle my money upon her,&rdquo; said Mr. Brookes, as he resumed his
      dusting; &ldquo;and for what? to keep an idle fellow in idleness. No, I'll not
      do it. She'll get over it&mdash;ah, it will be all the same a hundred
      years hence. But tell me, have you noticed&mdash;no, you notice nothing&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do; what do you want me to say, that she is looking very ill? I
      can't help it if she is. I've quite enough troubles of my own without
      thinking of other people's. I'm sure I am very sorry. I wish she'd never
      met the fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what I say, I wish she'd never met the fellow, and she never would
      had it not been for that horrible Southdown Road. Southwick has never been
      the same since those villas were put up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing about them; I won't know them. I don't go to the Horlocks
      because I may meet people there I don't want to know. If you hadn't
      allowed the girls to go there, she never would have met him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we had to call on the Horlocks. Every Viceroy that ever came to India
      called upon her, and they're excellent people&mdash;titled people come
      down from London to see them: but I daresay their banking accounts
      wouldn't bear looking into. She walks about the green with the chemist's
      wife, and has the people of the baths to dinner. Mostextraordinary woman.
      I like her, I enjoy her society; but I can't follow her in her opinions.
      She says that only men are bad; that all animals are good; that it is only
      men who make them bad. Her views on hydrophobia are most astonishing. She
      says it is a mild and easy death, and sees no reason why the authorities
      should attempt to stamp it out. She quite frightened me with the story she
      told me of a mad dog that died in her arms. But that by the way. The point
      is not now whether she is right to feed mice in her bedroom instead of
      getting rid of them, but whether we should call on people we don't want to
      know because she asks us to do so. I say we should not. When she spoke to
      me the other day about the lady whose mother was a housemaid, I said, 'My
      dear Mrs. Horlock, it is very well for you to call on those people. I
      approve of, I admire magnanimity; but what you can do I cannot do. You
      have no daughters to bring out; every Viceroy that ever came to India
      called on you, your position in the world is assured, your friends will
      not think the less of you no matter how intimately you know the chemist's
      wife, but you could not do these things if you had daughters to bring
      out.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did she say to that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was just going out to walk with her pugs. Angel began to&mdash;you
      know, and for the moment she could think of nothing else; when the little
      beast had finished I had forgotten the thread of my argument. However, I
      spoke to her about Grace; and she promised that she shouldn't meet the
      fellow again. I can't think of his name, I get lost in the different
      names, and they are all so alike I scarcely know one from the other. I
      have had nothing but trouble since your poor mother died. Your sisters
      give me a great deal of trouble, and you have given me a great deal of
      trouble. We couldn't get on in business together on account of your
      infernal slowness. No man is more for keeping his accounts and letters
      straight than I, but your exactitude drives me mad; it drives me mad;
      there you are at it again. I should like to know what you are copying into
      that diary. One would think you were writing an article for the <i>Times</i>,
      from the care with which you're drawing out every letter; 'pon my word it
      isn't writing at all, it's painting. You can't write for a pair of boots
      without taking a copy of the letter, entering it into this book, and
      entering it into that book; 'pon my word it is maddening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Willy laughed. &ldquo;Each person has his own way of doing business; I don't see
      how it interferes with you, or what difference it makes to you, if I spend
      three minutes or three days writing a letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not, perhaps not; but I am terribly upset about Grace,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Brookes, and he walked slowly across the room and stood looking at his
      Bouguereau; &ldquo;she'll get over it, but in any case she'll miss her chance of
      marrying Berkins; that is what distresses me. The man stinks of money. I
      hear that he has been appointed manager of a colliery, that alone will
      bring him another thousand a year. His business is going up, he must be
      worth now between seven and eight thousand a year. And he began as an
      office boy, he hadn't a penny piece, made it all himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I should think; a purse-proud ass!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, his eight thousand is as good an eight thousand as any in the
      land, better than a great many. I wouldn't give a snap of my fingers for
      your broken-down landowners; Berkins has always made excellent
      investments, and I hear he is now getting as much as fifteen per cent. for
      money invested.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Willy had been to Oxford, and the arrogance and pomposity of this
      purse-proud man shocked his sense of decorum. Berkins's vulgarity was more
      offensive than that of Mr. Brookes. Mr. Brookes was a simple, middle-class
      man, who had made money straightforwardly and honestly, and he had
      cultivated his natural taste for pictures to the limit of his capacities
      and opportunities. Berkins, however, had been born a gentleman, but had
      had to shift for himself, even when a lad, and he had caught at all
      chances; he was more sophisticated, he was a gentleman in a state of
      retrograde, and was in all points inferior to him whom he crossed in his
      descent. Berkins had bought a small place, a villa with some hundred acres
      attached to it, on the other side of Preston Park. There he had erected
      glass houses, and bred a few pheasants in the corner of a field, and it
      surprised him to find that the county families took no notice of him. Mr.
      Brookes had sympathised, but the young people laughed at him and Willy had
      told a story how he had been to shoot at &mdash;&mdash;, and when a
      partridge got up right in front of his gun, Berkins turned round and shot
      it, exclaiming: &ldquo;That's the way to bring them down!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And now whenever his name was mentioned, Willy thought of this incident,
      so very typical did it seem to him of the man, and he liked to twit his
      father with it. But Mr. Brookes could not be brought to see the joke, and
      he fell back on the plausible and insidious argument that, notwithstanding
      his manners, Berkins was worth eight thousand a year.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And very few girls get the chance of catching eight thousand a year; and
      she'll miss it, she'll miss it if she doesn't take care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You talk of it as if it were an absolute certainty; you don't know that
      Berkins wants to marry Grace; he hasn't been here for the last month.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Berkins is not like the young good-for-nothings your sisters waste
      their time with, he is a man of means, of eight thousand a year; you don't
      expect him to come round here every evening to tea, and to play tennis,
      and to walk in the moonlight and talk nonsense. Berkins is a man of means,
      he is a man who can make a settlement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he spoken to you on the subject, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Mr. Berkins is a man of tact, however you may laugh at him for having
      shot your partridge. He spoke to your Aunt Mary, or rather she spoke to
      him. Ah, clever woman, your Aunt Mary, wonderful manner, wonderful will,
      when she wants a thing done it must be done. Your poor mother&mdash;I mean
      no disparagement&mdash;but I must say she couldn't compare with her for
      determination; Sally reminds me of her, but Sally's determination is
      misdirected, deplorably misdirected; it is directed against me, entirely
      against me. She must be made submissive; when I spoke to Aunt Mary about
      her, she said her spirit must be broken; and if she were here she'd break
      it. If she were here things would be very different, your sisters wouldn't
      be flirting with all the little clerks in the Southdown Road; but I am
      alone. I have no one to turn to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were telling me that Berkins had spoken to Aunt Mary about Grace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Aunt Mary spoke to Berkins about Grace; she told him he ought to be
      thinking of marrying; that he wanted a wife. Then the conversation turned
      on my daughters, and Mary no doubt mentioned that at my death they would
      all have large fortunes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, so it is the money that Berkins is after.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Money comes first. If a man can make a settlement he will naturally
      demand a&mdash;that is to say he will naturally look forward, he will
      consider what her prospects are; not her immediate prospects, that would
      be mercenary, but her future prospects.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Willy smiled. &ldquo;And what did Berkins say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said he wanted to marry, and he spoke of Grace; he said he admired
      her. I shouldn't be surprised if we saw him at church to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to ask him to lunch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, if he's there.&rdquo; Then, after a long silence, Mr. Brookes said:
      &ldquo;He'll come in here to smoke. Of course you'll leave us alone. Do you mind
      leaving out your cigars?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have only half a box left; I think really you might keep some in the
      house to supply your own guests with. You always object if I interfere
      with your things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am out of my best cigars&mdash;it is so hard to remember. He won't
      smoke more than one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll put one in the cigar case then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better fill it; it will look so bad if there is only one; he
      won't take it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'll take all he can get; he took my bird, I know that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a matter of great importance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To you and to Grace, not to me,&rdquo; said Willy, and with very bad grace he
      unlocked a drawer, and placed a box of cigars on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. Now what time is it? Half-past ten. By Jove! we must be
      thinking of starting; I suppose you aren't coming?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid I've too much to do this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young ladies appeared in new dresses, and with prayer-books in their
      hands. Mr. Brookes took his hat and umbrella, and Willy watched them
      depart with undisguised satisfaction. &ldquo;Now I shall be able to get through
      some work,&rdquo; he said, untying a large bundle of letters. He wrote a page in
      his diary, tied up the letters, diary, and notebook in brown paper, and,
      with a sigh, admitting that he did not feel up to much work to-day, he
      took up the envelopes that had contained his letters and began tearing off
      the stamps, and he did this very attentively as if he did not trust his
      dry thick fingers. Somebody had told him that ten thousand old stamps were
      worth&mdash;he had forgotten the price of old stamps, and wondering he
      dozed off. When he awoke he cried: &ldquo;Half-past twelve, they must be on
      their way back; I wonder if Berkins is with them!&rdquo; And he strolled out on
      the gravel.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few spring flowers marked the brown earth about the trees, and a
      beautiful magnolia, white as a bride, shed its shell-like petals in an
      angle beneath a window; the gold of the berberis glowed at the end of the
      path; and the greenery was blithe as a girl in clear muslin and ribbons.
      The blackbirds chattered and ran, and in turn flew to the pan of water
      placed for them, and drank, lifting their heads with exquisite motion. The
      trees rustled in the cold wind; the sky was white along the embankment,
      where an engine moved slowly up and down the line.
    </p>
    <p>
      Willy was sensible that the scene was pleasant and pretty, and remembering
      he was fond of birds, he thrust his hands deeper in his pockets and walked
      slowly down the drive, his toes well turned out. &ldquo;I wonder if they met
      Berkins at church?&rdquo; was the question he put to himself gravely. &ldquo;What a
      cad he is! No wonder the county people fight shy of us; a fellow like that
      is enough to close their doors against us for ever. My father pooh-poohs
      everything but riches; he positively flies in their faces, so what can I
      do? I don't care to ask my Oxford friends down here; one never knows how
      he will receive them. He can talk of nothing but his business. Had I a
      free hand, had I not been so hampered, we might have known all the best
      county families, even theduke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The latch of the gate clicked, and Mr. Brookes and his family appeared.
      Maggie and Sally walked on the right and left of their father; Grace came
      on behind with Berkins, and it seemed to Willy that the city magnate bore
      himself with something even more than his usual dignity. At first sight he
      suggested that anomalous creature&mdash;a footman with a beard; and the
      slow, deliberate enunciation marked him as one accustomed to speak in
      public. His manner of sitting at a table suggested letters and dictation
      of letters, his manner of moving his glasses on his nose accounts, and at
      no moment would it have been surprising to see him place his strong finger
      at the bottom of a line of figures, and begin &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      During lunch, Sally and Maggie spoke in undertones; they glanced
      occasionally at Grace, who sat by and received Berkins's bald remarks with
      deference. The girls trembled with excitement; they had pressed and
      extorted from Grace a hurried statement of what had happened. Berkins had
      proposed to her, he had told her he had never seen any one except her whom
      he would care to make his wife. What had she said? She didn't know. She
      couldn't really remember. She had been taken so suddenly, she was so
      upset, that she hadn't known what to say. She thought she had said
      something about the honour&mdash;but she really had not had time to say
      much, for at that moment they were at the gate. Did she intend to accept
      him? She didn't know; she could not make up her mind. It was a terrible
      thing to throw over poor Jack; she didn't think she could do it&mdash;no
      matter what father might say. However, she knew he would never give his
      consent, so it was no use thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope she won't begin to cry,&rdquo; whispered Sally, who had followed Maggie
      to the sideboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father looks as if he were going to cry,&rdquo; replied Maggie, moving the
      decanters and pretending to look for a glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seven thousand a year, ten thousand a year! Would Grace have him? What
      would father settle on her? The sum he settled on her he must settle on
      them when they married. As Berkins's wife Grace would have servants,
      jewels, rich dresses, and a house in London, and they thought of the
      advantage this marriage would be to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The knives clattered; cheese and celery were being eaten. Mr. Brookes had
      drunk several glasses of port, and was on the verge of tears. Berkins's
      high shoulders and large voice dominated the dining-table; he was
      decidedly more than usually impressed by his own worth, and the worth of
      the money of which he was the representative. Willy chewed his cheese;
      there were many wrinkles about his eyes&mdash;deep lines turning towards
      the ears; and when he lifted his tumbler one noticed the little nails,
      almost worn away, of his lean hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Mr. Brookes said: &ldquo;I daresay you would like a cigar, Berkins&mdash;will
      you come into the billiard-room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Berkins inclined to this suggestion. Willy, who had not quite finished,
      remained at table. The girls watched each other, and as soon as the
      elderly men turned their backs they fled upstairs to their rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you try one of these?&rdquo; said Mr. Brookes, offering a box of choice
      havannas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. My tobacconist&mdash;I must ask you to visit his shop&mdash;receives
      just a few cases of a very special cigar; I have at least two-thirds of
      them, sometimes more; when you dine with me I'll give you one. This is
      Chartreuse, I think. My wine merchant knows a man whose cousin is one of
      the monks. Now the monks set aside the very cream of the liqueur, if I may
      so speak, for themselves. This liqueur cannot be bought in the open
      market. You may go up to London prepared to write a cheque for any figure
      you may like to name, and I will defy you to buy a bottle. I never have
      any other. It is really quite delicious. I daresay I could get you some.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Brookes expressed thanks for the amiable offer, and both men smoked on
      in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you play billiards?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Inwardly they congratulated themselves. Presently Mr. Brookes said: &ldquo;I
      hear you have been staying with my sister, Mrs. Haltom. You were shooting
      there, were you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, they were kind enough to ask me. Very nice shooting they have, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear that you have gone in for rearing pheasants.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; we shot a hundred brace last year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The conversation dropped, and in an impressive silence both men wondered
      what they had better say to lead honourably up to the subject they had
      come to speak on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is your house your own design? Did you build it entirely yourself?
      Iforget. I ought to know; you told me all about it when I dined with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was a house there, but I altered it considerably after my own idea,
      and not a bad idea, I flatter myself. I spent a good deal of money in
      laying out the grounds, putting up conservatories, and so forth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a single man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a single man the house is, of course, too large; but I do not intend
      to remain always single, and&mdash;and now, Mr. Brookes, as we are on the
      subject, I had better tell you that I have asked Miss Brookes to be my
      wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Brookes grasped at the first words. &ldquo;I am sure I am very pleased to
      hear it, Mr. Berkins, and I hope the answer was a favourable one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Brookes is a modest girl. She has been well brought up, as a girl
      who is, I hope, to be my wife should be, and she was naturally a little
      overcome. I did not exactly catch what she said, and I didn't like to
      press her for an immediate answer. But suppose we assume for the moment
      that Miss Brookes's reply will be a favourable one&mdash;I have, I
      confess, much faith in her good sense&mdash;we might consider the business
      side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding his admiration of a man who had made three thousand a year
      more than he had succeeded in doing, Mr. Brookes could not but feel
      irritated at Berkins, who, with increasing gravity, continued to assume
      all things to his own advantage. It had not occurred to him to consider
      that Grace might refuse him. Why should she refuse him? She could not hope
      to do better. She appeared to him as a very nice girl indeed, one entirely
      fitted for the position for which he intended her. He understood that all
      girls, at least those in society, were innocent and virtuous; he
      understood that when they married they made faithful and dutiful wives;
      and he had chosen her not because he had fallen in love, nor yet because
      he had noticed she was likely to make a better wife than her sisters, but
      because she was the eldest. Even so he would be twenty years his wife's
      senior, and he had chosen to marry one of the Brookes girls because he
      knew them and saw them constantly; because he knew that at their father's
      death his fortune would be divided between them. Grace was, therefore, an
      heiress in perspective. The prospect was agreeable, but he foresaw that it
      would be put forward as an excuse for fixing the sum of marriage
      settlements as low as possible. It would, however, be difficult for
      Brookes to settle less on his daughter than he, Berkins, was willing to
      settle on his wife; so partly in the hopes of forcing Mr. Brookes, and
      partly because of the pleasure it gave him to speak of himself, he
      continued talking of his position and possessions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In dealing with me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you are dealing, as you know, Mr. Brookes,
      with a man of means, a man who can afford to do the thing properly; you
      will not misunderstand me&mdash;you remember you told me that you had
      great difficulty in keeping the little folk who live here out of your
      house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The neighbourhood has never been the same since they put up that row of
      villas. A lot of indigent fortune-hunters, they know my girls will have
      large fortunes at my death, so they come sneaking round the place like so
      many wolves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can readily sympathise with you; one doesn't make money to keep idle
      young fellows in the luxuries of life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what I say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you aren't sufficiently firm, Mr. Brookes; had you been brought up in
      the hard school that I was you would be more firm; firmness is everything.
      You married early, I couldn't afford to do that. At sixteen I had to shift
      for myself. I was three years a clerk at two pounds a week, and not many
      chances to rise come in the way of a clerk at two pounds a week; he must
      be pretty sharp, and if he doesn't seize the little chance when it comes,
      he will remain a little clerk all his life. It is the first steps that are
      difficult, the rest are nothing. You don't know what the first steps are;
      I do. Once you've made a thousand pounds you can swim along a bit, but the
      first hundred, I shall never forget it! Afterwards it is just the same;
      the proportions are changed, that is all. The first twenty thousand is
      very uphill work, the second is on the flat, the third is going downhill&mdash;it
      brings itself along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very good simile indeed. There's no doubt that it is money that makes
      money. When you have none you cannot make it. It is like corn; give a man
      a handful, and he must be a fool if he can't fill his barn. The beginnings
      are hard; none knows that better than I. But for the last ten years I've
      been doing fairly well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had never intended to get married, but when money really begins to
      accumulate it pushes you along. It is curious how money takes you along.
      It is like a tide. You first begin thinking of a little place in the
      country where you can stay from Saturday till Monday. The little place
      grows; it is extraordinary how it grows. You find you want flowers, and
      you put up a glass house; then you begin to get interested in orchids or
      roses, and you put up two, maybe half a dozen glass houses. Suddenly you
      find the rabbits are breeding in the hedgerows, and you go out yonder
      ferretting, but the coachman does not know how to manage the ferrets, and
      you start a keeper. The keeper says one morning, 'It wouldn't require much
      to get up a stock of pheasants in that little wood.' You say, 'Very well;'
      and there you are before you know it, with glass houses, rabbit-shooting,
      and a pheasant preserve. You have friends to stay with you for the
      shooting, you get talked about in the clubs, people ask why you aren't
      married&mdash;the place where the wife ought to be stares you in the face:
      a man of money, of real money, must get married. The friends who come and
      stay with you suggest a little dance, you think it would be very pleasant;
      but you know no one in the neighbourhood, the county people won't visit
      you, so the thing comes about, and you are head over heels in settlements
      before you know where you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you find the county people very standoffish over Preston Park way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not in a position to judge; they could not very well call on me
      situated as I am, a young&mdash;well, I will say, a marriageable&mdash;man,
      known to be wealthy; but I have no doubt when I am married they will call
      on us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twirl them round my little finger, stuck-up lot; I should like to know
      what they have to be proud of, half of them are broken&mdash;their land is
      worthless. Give me good sound investments, five or six per cent. For some
      money I am getting seven; the waterworks pays fourteen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The conversation suddenly dropped, they looked at each other blankly; they
      felt they had talked a good deal, but without approaching any nearer the
      subject they had met to speak on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our intention was,&rdquo; said Berkins, in his most solemn and professional
      manner, &ldquo;assuming that Miss Brookes is not averse from my suit, to discuss
      the business side, for there is a business side to all questions, as you,
      Mr. Brookes, will be the first to see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Brookes had begun to anger; he would have liked to have answered that
      such a discussion was altogether premature, but he yielded before
      Berkins's authoritative manner, and he replied instead that he would be
      glad indeed to hear whatever proposal Mr. Berkins had to make.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to say, then&mdash;I will assume that we stand as man to
      man, equal; you have probably more money invested than I; I am making
      possibly a larger income&mdash;you will forgive me if I am mistaken, but
      you told me the other day as we went up in the train that you had had a
      very bad year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three thousand dead loss. It does not matter so much to me, my money is
      invested, but it would have gone hard with many a man who was relying on
      his business. Three thousand pounds dead loss!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How was that? I suppose the temperance societies affect you; they must
      have had a great effect on the sale of liquor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one who was not in the trade would believe in the falling off in the
      quantity of whisky drunk. But it was not that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trade generally, trade depression affects every one; the failure of one
      makes bad debts for the other. It was bad debts that did it. It was very
      stupid of me, but I was worried at home: those fortune-hunters from the
      villas&mdash;my daughters are very young, and since their poor mother died
      they have had no one to look after them. Willy, too, is a great trial to
      me. Poor boy, he is most anxious to do something, but things don't go
      right with him; he thought he was going to do a good thing in a Bond
      Street shop that was converted into a company, but he lost two thousand
      pounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought he was in the distillery with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was for a while, but he irritated me; he is so confoundedly
      methodical, everything must go into his diary, he spends half the day
      filling it up. Besides after you have conducted a business so many years
      you don't want a partner; you have your own way of doing things, and don't
      want to be interfered with. He draws a certain income, but he has nothing
      now to do with the business. We were talking of settlements.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not act as I should regarding the villa residences. I would put
      them down. I would not have it; but, as you say, we were talking of
      settlements. I think I said we stood as man to man. In round numbers your
      fortune equals mine, mine equals yours&mdash;very well, let us act
      equally. I will settle five hundred a year on Miss Brookes, do you
      likewise; what do you say to that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh, pooh! I couldn't think of such a thing. Five hundred a year!&rdquo; said
      Mr. Brookes, and throwing his cigar into the fireplace, he walked up the
      room indignantly. &ldquo;I was wrong to consent to discuss the matter; to say
      the least, it is premature; I never heard of such a thing. Five hundred a
      year! This is worse than the Southdown Road, many degrees worse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, such insinuations are most uncalled for; I must beg of you to
      withdraw them. I must ask you to remember you are talking to one at least
      in the same position as yourself, to a man of seven thousand a year!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh, pooh! seven thousand a year&mdash;you are making that to-day,
      to-morrow you mayn't be making three. Yours isn't invested money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Berkins had risen from the great leather armchair, and he stood
      expressionless as a piece of office furniture, his grave face divided by
      the green shade of the billiard lamp; Mr. Brookes remained with his back&mdash;his
      straight fat back bound in a new frock coat that defined the senile
      fatness of the haunches&mdash;turned to his guest. He stooped as if to
      examine his favourite Linnell, but, in his passion, he did not see it. The
      table, covered with a grey cloth, lay like an account spread out between
      the moneyed men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Taking your words into due consideration, I think I had better wish you
      good-morning, Mr. Brookes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Berkins, I would not wish you to misunderstand me,&rdquo; said Mr. Brookes,
      whom the prospect of losing seven thousand a year had suddenly cooled. &ldquo;My
      daughter will have&mdash;my children, I should say&mdash;will have my
      fortune divided amongst them at my death, and when we come to go into
      figures you will find&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But in the meantime, what do you propose to settle on her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Brookes hesitated. He was angry at being pressed. Berkins's
      domineering tone irritated him; he would have liked to bundle him from the
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he said: &ldquo;I think, considering the very large sums of money my
      daughters will come into at my death, that a settlement of two hundred a
      year is ample.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, in that case I shall settle the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could not, I will not, consent to any such arrangement. The man my
      daughter marries must settle on her a sum of money equivalent&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To what you settle on her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To her position, to her expectations,&rdquo; replied Mr. Brookes, growing more
      and more angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don't know what her expectations are; you may marry again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not intend to marry again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very possibly, but I know nothing of that; business is business, and I
      should be a fool if I settle five hundred to your two hundred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Brookes stopped in his walk, and he looked at Berkins, who stood, his
      hand laid upon the billiard table as upon a huge balance sheet. The word
      business had carried the men back to their offices in London, and, quite
      forgetful of the subject of their bargaining, each strove to obtain an
      advantage over the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, let us say two hundred and fifty, that is my last word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, Mr. Brookes, I will not take your daughter.&rdquo;

    <p>
      &ldquo;Willy, make haste, I beg of you; I shall miss my train. It is now exactly
      half-past nine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better go without me; I cannot start now. I haven't nearly got my
      things together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Willy walked from room to room tying and untying brown paper parcels in
      his most methodical and most dilatory manner. His sisters stood watching
      him from the drawing-room door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did father tell you nothing when Berkins left? They had a row, hadn't
      they? It isn't off, is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you would not speak so loud, Sally; you can be heard all over the
      house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do tell us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don't know. Father was very much upset. I couldn't speak to him
      about my own business, I know that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I suppose we shall hear about it to-night. You are going to meet
      Frank in Brighton, aren't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; he is coming to lunch with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't keep him all day; send him on here, we might have a game of
      tennis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Willy did not answer; and he thought as he went upstairs, what a trouble
      young girls were in a house. &ldquo;They think of nothing but pleasure, nothing
      but pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One, two, or three more delays, and he was ready, and with his brown paper
      parcel tucked under his arm he set forth. Upon the young blue of the sky,
      the fresh green of the buds melted. There were a few elms, but hardly
      enough to constitute an avenue. The house looked as if it had been
      repeatedly altered. It ran into unexpected corners and angles; but it was
      far enough from the road to justify a gate lodge. The swards were
      interspersed with shrubs in the most modern fashion, and the sumptuous
      glass-houses could be seen gleaming in the sun. It was a hot day, and the
      brick wall was dappled with hanging foliage, and further out, opposite the
      windows of the &ldquo;Stag and Hounds,&rdquo; where Steyning's ales could be obtained,
      the over-reaching sprays of a great chestnut tree fell in delicate tracery
      on the white dust. The road led under the railway embankment, and looking
      through the arched opening, one could see the dirty town, straggling along
      the canal or harbour, which runs parallel with the sea. A black stain was
      the hull of a great steamer lying on her side in the mud, but the tapering
      masts of yachts were beautiful on the sky, and at the end of a row of
      slatternly houses there were sometimes spars and rigging so strange and
      bygone that they suggested Drake and the Spanish main.
    </p>
    <p>
      Southwick is half a suburb, half a village. In the summer months the green
      seems a living thing. It is there the children talk and tumble when school
      is over. They are told to go to the green, they are forbidden to go to the
      green, and it is from the green the eldest girl leads the naughty boy
      howling. When they are a little older they avoid the green, it is too
      public then. It is to the green that elevens come from far and near to
      play their matches. All the summer through the green is a <i>fete</i> of
      cricket. It is to the green the brass bands come on Saturday. On the
      green, bat and trap is played till the ball disappears in shadow. The
      green is common; horses and cows are turned out there. All profit by the
      green. It is on the edge of the green the housewives come to talk in the
      limpid moonlight. It is on the green the fathers smoke when the little
      cottage rooms are unbearable with summer heat. It is on the green that
      Mrs. Horlock walks with her pugs and the chemist's wife, to the enormous
      scandal of the neighbourhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the right, facing the embankment, and overlooking some fields, is the
      famous Southdown road, and parallel with the green is Mr. Brookes's
      property&mdash;a solid five acres, with all modern improvements and
      embellishments, and surrounded by a brick wall over six feet high.
    </p>
    <p>
      Willy hated Southwick. He thought it ugly and vulgar; he regretted deeply
      that his father would make no advances, and that they were as far from
      county society to-day as when they came to live in the place thirty years
      ago. &ldquo;I knew the best people when I was at Oxford, why can I not know them
      now? Here we are doing the same thing from year's end to year's end; why,
      with our money we ought to be hob-nobbing with the duke.&rdquo; In moments of
      dejection this was one of Willy's commonest thoughts. &ldquo;I did my best, but
      I was opposed. Father doesn't care, and as for the girls, they'll take up
      with any man so long as he is young. Still, in spite of them I should have
      got on if I hadn't lost my nerve and had to give up hunting; and without
      hunting there is no way of making acquaintances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Willy had relied on a hunter as Berkins had on pheasants and glass-houses.
      But he hated hunting, and finding he got no further than a few breakfasts,
      he had told a story of a heavy fall and sold his horses. He had then
      insisted on dinner-parties, and some few people more or less &ldquo;county&rdquo; had
      been collected; the pretext was politics, but Willy and politics were but
      a doleful mixture, and the scheme collapsed. The family was not endowed
      with any social qualifications, Willy least of all, and having failed to
      advance himself individually, and his family collectively, he threw up the
      game.
    </p>
    <p>
      We rarely cultivate for long things in which we may not succeed in&mdash;the
      lady with a small waist pinches it, the man with pretty feet wears pretty
      shoes, and in no circumstances could Willy have shone in society. He
      failed to interest the ladies he met on the King's Road, he knew this; and
      to sum up his deficiencies, let us say he was lacking in &ldquo;go.&rdquo; He was too
      timid to succeed with the more facile loves whom he met in the evenings on
      the pier. All the same he had had his love affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! men of inferior aspect and speech, often in you a true heart abides;
      you, and you only, are faithful to the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this unromantic person a shred of pure romance was attached. None knew
      the whole story, and none spoke of it now; but his sisters remembered that
      Willy had fallen in love with a girl whom he had seen play &ldquo;Sweet Anne
      Page.&rdquo; They remembered long letters, tears and wild looks. He had sent her
      diamonds; and one night he had attempted suicide. All was now forgotten;
      at least it was the past, and nothing remained but one little melody which
      he had heard her sing, and which he sometimes whistled out of tune.
    </p>
    <p>
      But sooner or later a man's talents, and if not his talents, his tastes,
      appear through the mists of youth, and henceforth they lead him. Willy's
      efforts in society had resulted in abortive dinner-parties, his efforts in
      sport had been cut short by nerves, his efforts in dissipation had left
      him with a tolerably well-filled wardrobe, his efforts in love had brought
      him tears and a commonplace mistress, whom he kept in the necessaries of
      life in various lodging-houses. So his youth had passed; but in all this
      mediocrity a certain spirit of resistance endured. His taste for figures
      grew more pronounced; he surrounded himself with account books, letter
      books, and diaries; he took note of every penny that passed through his
      hands. Money-making, profitable investments&mdash;that was to be his aim
      in life; and as each year closed his thoughts fixed themselves more
      definitely and entirely on it; and it was natural that it should be so,
      since all other outlets for the passion of life were barred to him. His
      forced retirement from the distillery did not worry him. No one could
      please his father in business; his uncle had once threatened to throw his
      brother out of the window. Besides, the business was a declining one, and
      twelve thousand pounds for a junior partnership was not bad. Nor did his
      failure to make a success of the manure agency discourage him; the shop
      was a different matter, that was his own idea, he had thought of a
      fortune, and had lost two thousand pounds. It had crippled him for life.
      True enough, there were other things to do. Some stockbrokers make twenty
      per cent. on their money, not in wild speculation, but in straightforward
      genuine business. He might go up to London and learn the business&mdash;he
      had heard that it would not take more than six months or a year to pick it
      up&mdash;and start on his own account. A thousand pounds would be
      sufficient to begin with; or he might buy a partnership&mdash;he could do
      that for three or four thousand. Either of these courses would suit him,
      the latter for preference, but a certain amount of capital would be
      necessary before he could take either, and that he hadn't got, and to all
      appearances it would be very difficult to persuade his father to consent
      to drawany more money out of the distillery.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Willy's thoughts ran as he ascended the flight of wooden steps that led
      to the platform of the little country station. &ldquo;The folk down here think
      there is nothing in me, that I am good for nothing but walking up and down
      the King's Road, but they little know what I have in my head. I'll make
      them open their eyes one of these days.&rdquo; The sting of vanity is in us all.
      Our heads may be greed, our bellies lust, our limbs charity, faithfulness,
      truth, and goodwill, but in some cranny of our tails vanity always lies,
      only it may be marvellously well hidden, as in Willy. The keenest observer
      would not have detected it in him, and when he came out of his habitual
      reserve and lamented that bad luck had always followed him and spoke of
      his projects, one might have suspected him of greed, but hardly of vanity.
      Now he stood leaning on the wooden paling, and his movements showed the
      back and loins in strong outline, marking the thick calves. Without taking
      any heed, his eyes followed the cricket ball, which was in turn slogged
      into the horse-pond and cottage gardens. Through long familiarity, the
      green had faded from his notice, nor did the burnt-up crops on the Downs
      attract his thoughts, nor yet the sinuous lines of the hills. From the
      platform one saw the whole of Southwick. The green with its cricket match,
      Mrs. Horlock and her dogs, the forge, the stile, the various cottages, the
      long fields full of green wheat, and, far away, the carriages passing like
      insects along the road under the Downs; then on the right were the back
      gardens of the cottages, a large inscription announcing the different
      branches of the grocery business, a few fields with cows leaning their
      muzzles over the rough palings, some more cottages, a barn, and then the
      magnificent five acres of the Manor House, rich with glass-houses, and
      beautiful in a cloud of trees. From the platform of the station one could
      see the sea, not much of it, but one could see the sea; the slates of the
      street that went along the water's edge did not quite bar the view. The
      very small presence of Southwick contrived to hide the sea; even when one
      walked to the water's side the great mass of shingle which forms the outer
      bank of the canal allowed only one narrow rim of blue to appear. The
      inhabitants forget they live by the sea, and when the breeze fills their
      gardens with a smell of boats and nets they think of the sea with
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tired of the monotonous running to and fro of the cricket players, Willy
      walked up the platform. Arrow-like, the line lay in front of him, and in
      the tinted distance, in faint lines and flashes of light and shade,
      Brighton stretched from hill to hill. Morning was still in the sky, and
      the sea was deep blue between the yellow chimney-pots. A puff of steam
      showed up upon a distant field, and the train came along from Portslade,
      one of the links of the great chain of towns that binds the south coast.
      &ldquo;I hope Frank won't arrive in Brighton before me,&rdquo; thought Willy.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had been big boy and little boy at school. The vivacity of the Celt
      amused the good-natured south Saxon, and when Lord Mount Rorke called to
      see his nephew, he found him talking with Brookes. Once Willy had been
      invited to spend part of his holidays at Mount Rorke. Afterwards they
      visited each other's rooms, and so their friendship had been decided, and,
      in spite of&mdash;or, perhaps, on account of&mdash;a very marked
      difference in their characters and temperaments, gathered strength as it
      matured. Another link between the men was that Escott had accompanied
      Willy to the theatre when he went to see the actress whom he had loved so
      madly. Frank had heard her sing the song which Willy whistled when his
      thoughts went wandering. Willy confided in no one&mdash;great sorrows
      cannot be and never are confided; but Frank had seen her, and he played
      her songs on the piano, and that was enough for Willy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young men had not seen each other for two years. Frank had shown some
      taste for painting, and his uncle, whose heir he was, had sent him, if not
      to study, at least to think about art in Italy. From Italy he had gone to
      Greece and Russia, he had returned home through Germany, he had visited
      Holland and France.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the London train come in?&rdquo; Willy asked when he arrived in Brighton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, just come in, about five minutes,&rdquo; said the man as he opened
      the door. Willy waited until the train had stopped dead, he got out
      carefully, and, looking through the confusion of luggage and bookstall
      trade, he saw Escott questioning a porter and hailing a carriage. &ldquo;By
      Jove! I shall miss him,&rdquo; cried Willy, and he hastened his steps and broke
      into a sharp trot. &ldquo;Frank! Frank!&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there you are!&rdquo; cried Frank, and he lifted his stick, and called
      sharply to a large black and white bull-dog that paddled about on its bow
      legs, saliva dripping from its huge jaws, looking in its hideousness like
      something rare and exquisite from Japan. He dismissed the porter and the
      carriage, which he had hailed with an arrogant wave of his stick. He was
      tall and he was thin. His trousers were extremely elegant, a light cloth,
      black and white check, hung on his legs in graceful lines, and he wore
      tiny boots with light brown cloth tops. The jacket and waistcoat were in
      dark brown cloth, and the odour of the gardenia in his buttonhole
      contrasted with that of the sachet-scented silk pocket-handkerchief which
      lay in his side pocket. His throat showed white and healthy in the high
      collar tied with a white silk cravat in a sailor's knot, fastened with a
      small diamond. His hands were coarse and brown; he wore two rings, and a
      bracelet fell out of his cuff when he dropped his arm. His chest was broad
      and full, but the shoulders were too square; the coat was padded. There
      was little that could be called Celtic in his face or voice, the admixture
      of race was manifested in that dim blue stare, at once vague and wild,
      which the eyes of the Celt so often exhibit. The nose was long, low, and
      straight, the nostrils were cleanly marked, the mouth was uncertain, the
      chin was uncertain, the face was long, deadly pale, rather large, the
      forehead was high, receding at the temples. The hair (now he removes his
      hat, for the air is heavy and hot, and the sun falls fiercely on the
      pavement) is pale brown, and it waves thinly over the high forehead, so
      expressive of a vague and ill-considered idealism. Frank Escott was of
      Saxon origin on his father's side, but the family had been in Ireland for
      the last two hundred years, and had married into many Irish families that
      had at different times received direct contributions of Celtic blood. Long
      residence in England had removed all Irish accent and modes of speech; but
      in hook, and book, and cook he lengthened the vowel sound. Occasionally a
      something strange grated on the ear, and declared him not of the south of
      England, suggested the north, and insinuated Cumberland; an actor could
      not reproduce these trifling differences with caricaturing them. He was
      absolutely good-looking, and he was too well dressed. He laughed a good
      deal, and his conversation was sprinkled with cynical remarks and cutting
      observations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't seem to go in for dress now as you used to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't the money to spend on it; but tell me, don't you like this
      suit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, pretty well; whose is it? Did Walpole make it? Do you deal with him
      still?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is one of Walpole's, but I have had it turned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had it turned? I have heard of turning an overcoat, but a morning coat! I
      did not know it could be done; that's what makes it look so shaky.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now don't you get laughing at my coat, it looks very well indeed. I
      suppose you think I am not fit to walk with you. I daresay it doesn't look
      as smart as yours, which has just come out of Walpole's shop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young men had so much to say, and were so genuinely glad to see each
      other, that their thoughts hesitated and they were embarrassed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you enjoyed your trip abroad very much,&rdquo; Willy said drily and
      punctiliously; &ldquo;you were more than a year away&mdash;nearly eighteen
      months, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About that. I enjoyed myself. I think I liked Italy best; it has been
      more painted and described than any country, and yet it is quite different
      from what one imagines; it is grey and dim and green and dusty. It looks&mdash;how
      shall I put it?&mdash;it looks worn out and faded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The women aren't worn out and faded if all one hears is true,&rdquo; said
      Willy, with a short laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The women are right enough. I must tell you about them one of these days,
      lots of stories. There was a little Italian girl I met at Milan. It was a
      job to get away from her; she followed me, 'pon my word, she did; she
      declared she would commit suicide. I was awfully frightened. Naples is
      really too shocking. I'm not a prude, but Naples is really&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it is the same all over the Continent. One of these days I must
      go abroad and have a look round. You were a long time in Rome?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, only a few weeks, but I was too taken up with the pictures to think
      of anything else. The Michael Angelos are beyond anything any one can
      imagine. He is the only one who can compare with the Greeks, and I don't
      see why one shouldn't say he is as great. Of course there are things, the
      daughters of&mdash;I forget the name&mdash;the group of two women leaning
      back in each other's arms in the British Museum. But I don't know, Michael
      Angelo is quite different, and I can't see that anything can be said to be
      finer than the figures of Day and Night&mdash;how often I have drawn them&mdash;the
      figure of Night, the heavy breasts to show that she has suckled the Day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But which way are we going? I must go to Truefitt's to have my hair cut.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven't forgotten the old place, I see. Do you still keep up your
      subscription?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose mine has run out, I have been abroad so long. Nothing like a
      good shampoo; for a guinea a year you can have it done as often as you
      like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't subscribed lately. There used to be such a pretty girl at the
      counter. Do you remember?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You dog, always thinking of them,&rdquo; and laughing loudly they passed
      through the shop, and it was Frank that stared most at the young lady.
      They read <i>Punch</i> aloud to each other; they cracked jokes with the
      hairdressers; they snorted and laughed through the soap and jets of hot
      and cold water. Frank allowed scent and ivories to be pressed upon him by
      the young lady at the counter; Willy declined to be led into such
      extravagances.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he stepped out into the shine of the street, and took step from his
      friend, he said: &ldquo;By George! it makes me feel young again. It is just like
      old times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it does make one feel jollier, doesn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How jolly it is here; not too warm, just nice. What shall we do? Sit down
      on that bench in front of the pier?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm agreeable. How jolly it is. Just look at those boats! One could make
      a picture of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Over the sea hung a white veil of mist, but the sun glowed through and
      melted into it, and harmonised it with the water green and translucent.
      The sea sucked about the shingle with little sudden sighs; the sails of
      the pleasure boat waved in the fairy-like depths, and all the little brown
      fishing-boats lay becalmed, heaving tremulously like tired butterflies
      upon the breast of a blue flower. The nursemaids lay together on the
      shingle, and their novels slipped down the stones to their feet. The
      children played with the tide and the sand. There were crowds of women&mdash;Jewesses
      with loud dresses: and the strange world of bath chairs! Ladies so old
      that they seem certain to fall to pieces when they are taken out; ladies
      with chestnut curls soft and fresh&mdash;why were they in bath chairs?
      General officers, mounted on white Arabs; acrobats and songs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young men sat facing the sea. Frank called, &ldquo;Triss, Triss. Splendid
      dog that is. If I were to let him he would guzzle the other dog in about
      two minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He looks a ferocious brute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't like dogs? You couldn't see a handsomer dog than that;
      unfortunately, he's the wrong colour; if he were brindle or white, he'd
      take a first prize. Come here, you brute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amid some little excitement and anxious looks, Triss came up, growling and
      showing his teeth. Frank explained that it was only his manner. Frank took
      the paw that was extended to him, but Triss's friendliness seemed somewhat
      dubious, for he still further uncovered his formidable fangs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really don't care to sit here with that ferocious brute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you he won't bite, it is only his manner. Isn't it, Triss? Kiss
      me, kiss me at once,&rdquo; and amid many growls of almost subterranean
      awfulness, the dog licked his master's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you would tie him up&mdash;to oblige me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Highly pleased at the fear and wonder his dog had struck in the gaudy
      Jewesses and the shaky generals, Frank threatened and finally forced the
      dog to lie down. He continued to expatiate on the dog's points&mdash;the
      number of wrinkles, the bandiness of the legs, etc. The conversation
      dropped in heat and glare, and the picturesqueness of the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How horribly out of tune you do whistle&mdash;you go into a different
      key; this is more like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, how sweetly she used to sing it. Do you remember the night we went
      to see her, the last time the piece was played? I threw her a bouquet, a
      splendid one it was, too, cost me three guineas in Covent Garden. We went
      afterwards and had supper at Scott's in the Haymarket. How jolly those
      days were. I don't seem to be able to enjoy myself now as I used to then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has become of her? One never hears of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She died soon after.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry I spoke of her; I didn't know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it doesn't matter.&rdquo; Then after a long silence, Willy said: &ldquo;I hear
      your engagement is broken off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Frank drew a long and expressive breath, and, with melodramatic
      movements of the shoulders, he sighed. &ldquo;I have not seen you since. Oh, I
      had terrible scenes with the father. They had a house up the river. I
      followed them, and put up at the Angler's Hotel. She told her father that
      I must be allowed to come to the house, and he had to give way. You don't
      know the river? Well, it is wonderful to awake at Maidenhead in the
      morning and hear the sparrows twittering in a piece of tangled vine; to
      see that great piece of water flowing so mildly in all the pretty summer
      weather. We used to live in flannels, and spent long afternoons together
      in the boat&mdash;we had such a spiffing boat, as light and as clean in
      the water as a fish&mdash;and we used to linger in the bulrushes, and come
      back when the moon was rising with our hands full of flowers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why was it broken off?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My uncle, old Mount Rorke, wants me to marry an heiress, and I have
      nothing except what he allows me, or scarcely anything. She used to wear a
      broad-brimmed straw hat, and the shadow fell over her face. I made a lot
      of sketches. I must show them to you one of these days when you come up to
      town, and I filled an album with verses. I used to write them at night. My
      window was right in front of the river, and the moon used to sail past,
      and in the morning I used to read her the poems I made overnight beneath
      the branches of the cedar, where we used to run the boat. But the father
      was a brute. I got the best of him once though. It was a private view day
      at the Academy, and he had forbidden Nellie to speak to me&mdash;even to
      notice me. I went straight up to her, and took her away under his very
      nose before he could stop us. We walked about all day. Oh! he was mad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she was willing to brave her father in that way, why was your
      engagement broken off?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My uncle was so very difficult to deal with. I didn't see her for some
      time.&rdquo; Frank did not say&mdash;perhaps, he did not know&mdash;that his
      engagement had been broken off through his own instability and weakness of
      character. The young lady, whom he called Nellie, had told him she would
      wait if he would elect a profession and work for a place in it. But Frank
      had not been able to forego late hours and restaurants, and Nellie had
      married some one who could. &ldquo;You know I converted her. Doesn't her father
      hate me for that! We used to go to high mass at the oratory. I explained
      to her the whole of the Catholic religion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I thought you didn't believe in it yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am talking of some time ago; besides, a woman, it isn't quite the same
      thing; and if I have saved her soul! I don't know if I told you that I was
      writing a novel; I don't think I did. The idea of it is this: A young man
      has loved three women. The first charmed him by her exceeding beauty; he
      lives with her for a time. The second captivates him, or rather holds him
      through his senses; his love for her is merely a sensuality; then he falls
      in love with a fair young girl as pure as falling snow of any stain in
      deed or in thought; he is engaged to marry her&mdash;or, I don't know, I
      haven't made up my mind on that point, perhaps it would be better if he
      did marry her. Well, the woman whom he has loved with a merely sensual
      passion comes back, and to revenge herself she tries to tempt the good
      girl to go wrong; she talks to her of men and pleasures; this is a good
      idea, I think, for I feel sure it is women far more than men who lead
      women astray. Then the first woman whom he has loved for her beauty
      merely, comes along and continues the diabolical work of the first, by
      suggesting&mdash;I don't know, anything&mdash;that the young girl should
      go in for dress; the young man finds out the scheme, and to save the girl
      he murders her, he is thrown into prison, he is tried, and in the crowded
      Court he makes a great speech&mdash;he tells how he murdered her to save
      her from sin, he tells the judge that on the Judgment Day a pure white
      soul will plead for him. What an opportunity for a piece of splendid
      writing! The Court would be filled with fashionable women, that weep and
      sob, they cannot contain themselves, the judge would wish to stop the
      young man, but he cannot. What a splendid scene to describe! And the young
      man goes to execution confident, and assured that he has done well. What
      do you think of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is really difficult for me to say; I never like giving an opinion on a
      subject I don't understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know; but what do you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately for Willy's peace, the conversation was at this moment
      violently interrupted by Triss. He rushed forth, and Frank was only in
      time to prevent a pitched battle. He returned leading the dog by his silk
      handkerchief, amid the murmur of nurse-maids and Jewesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the worst of him; he never can see a big dog without wanting to go
      for him. Down, sir, down&mdash;I won't have you growl at me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't see what pleasure you can find in a brute like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you he's very good-tempered; he has a habit of growling, but he
      does not mean anything by it. What were we talking about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we were talking about the ladies. Have you seen anything nice
      lately? What's the present Mrs. Escott like, dark or fair?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There isn't one, I assure you. I met rather a nice woman at my uncle's,
      about two months ago, a Lady Seely. I don't know that you would call her a
      pretty woman; rather a turned-up nose, a pinched-in waist, beautiful
      shoulders. Hair of a golden tinge, diamonds, and dresses covered with
      beads. She flirted a great deal. We talked about love, and we laughed at
      husbands, and she asked me to come and see her in rather a pointed way. It
      is rather difficult to explain these things, but I think that if I were to
      go in for her&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you would pull it off?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young men laughed loudly, and then Frank said: &ldquo;But somehow I don't
      much care about her. I met such a pretty girl the other day at the
      theatre. There were no stalls, and as I wanted to see the piece very much,
      I went into the dress circle. There was only one seat in the back row. I
      struggled past a lot of people, dropped into my place, and watched the
      piece without troubling myself to see who was sitting next to me. It was
      not until the <i>entr'acte</i> that I looked round. I felt my neighbour's
      eyes were fixed upon me. She was one of the prettiest girls you ever saw
      in your life&mdash;a blonde face, pale brown hair, and such wonderful
      teeth&mdash;her laughter, I assure you, was beautiful. I asked her what
      she thought of the piece. She looked away and didn't answer. It was rather
      a slap in the face for me, but I am not easily done. I immediately said:
      'I should have apologised before for the way I inconvenienced you in
      crushing into my seat, but, really, the place is so narrow that you don't
      know how to get by.' This rather stumped her, she was obliged to say
      something. The girl on the other side (not half a bad looking girl, short
      brown curly hair, rather a roguish face) was the most civil at first. She
      wasn't as pretty as the one next to me, but she spoke the more willingly;
      the one next to me tried to prevent her. However, I got on with them, one
      thing led to another, and when the piece was over, I fetched their hats
      and coats and we walked a little way up the street together. I tried to
      get them to come to supper; they couldn't do that, for they had to be in
      at a certain time, so we went to Gatti's and had some coffee. I couldn't
      make out for a long time what they were; they were evidently not
      prostitutes, and they did not seem to me to be quite ladies. What do you
      think they were?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't an idea&mdash;actresses?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. They wouldn't tell me for a long time. I got it out of them at last;
      they're at the bar in the Gaiety Restaurant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bar girls?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some of those bar girls are very pretty; rather dangerous, though, I
      should think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They seemed to me to be very nice girls; you would be surprised if you
      heard them talk. I assure you the one that sat next to me spoke just like
      a lady. You know in these hard times people must do something. Lots of
      ladies have to buckle to and work for their bread.&rdquo;

      Frank lapsed into silence. Willy sat apparently watching the blue and
      green spectacle of the sea. Frank knew that it interested him not the
      least, and he wondered if his friend had heard what he had been saying.
      Triss, seeing that smelling and fighting were equally vain endeavours, had
      laid himself out in the sun, and he returned his master's caresses by deep
      growls. One more menacing than the others woke Willy from his meditation,
      and he said: &ldquo;What's the time? It ought to be getting on to lunch time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I daresay it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where shall we go? Do you know of a good place? What about that
      restaurant opposite the pier?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Willy, with a short, abrupt laugh, &ldquo;the fact is, I must lunch
      at my office; but I shall be very glad if you will come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't know you had an office&mdash;an office for what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I started an agency at the beginning of the year for artificial manure,
      but I think I shall drop it. I am arranging to go on the Stock Exchange.
      The difficulty is whether I shall be able to get my father to allow me to
      take enough money out of the business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The distillery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but what about this office? Why are you obliged to lunch at your
      office? Are you expecting customers? I know nothing about that sort of
      thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I wish I were. The fact is, my missis is staying in Brighton for a
      few weeks. The child has been ailing a good deal lately, and the doctor
      ordered change of air.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Child! Missis! I know nothing of this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very nice woman, I think you'll like her. She is devoted to me. We've
      been together now two years or more, I can't say exactly, I should have to
      refer to my diary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The child isn't mine. She had the child before I knew her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is the matter with it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Curvature of the spine. The doctor says she will outgrow it. Cissy will
      be quite strong and healthy although she may never have what you would
      call a good figure. But there is a matter on which I want to speak to you.
      The fact is, I am going to be married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the lady whom you will see at lunch, Cissy's mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frank said: &ldquo;If you really love her I have nothing to say against it.&rdquo;
       Willy did not answer. Frank waited for an answer and then broke the
      silence: &ldquo;But do you love her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am very fond of her; she is a very good sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frank was implacable. &ldquo;Do you love her like the other one?&rdquo; The question
      wounded, but Frank was absorbed in his own special sentimentalities.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was younger then, it is not the same; I am getting old. How many years
      older am I than you&mdash;seven, I think? You are three-and-twenty, I am
      thirty. How time flies!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am three-and-twenty&mdash;you don't look thirty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel it, though; few fellows have had so much trouble as I have. Your
      life has been all pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If a man really loves a woman he is always right to marry her. Why should
      we suppose that a woman may not reform&mdash;that true love may not raise
      her? I was talking to a novelist the other day; he told me thestory of a
      book he is writing. It is about a woman who leaves the husband she has
      never loved for the man she adores; she goes away with him, he marries
      her, and she sinks lower and lower, until she becomes a common
      prostitute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are quite mistaken. I am sure that when you see the missis&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow, pray do not misunderstand me. I would not for worlds. I
      am only telling you about a book, if you will only listen. I told him that
      I thought the story would be ten times as interesting if, instead of being
      degraded, the woman were raised by the love of the man who took her away
      from her husband. He made the husband a snivelling little creature, and
      the lover good-looking&mdash;that's the old game. I would have made the
      lover insignificant and the husband good-looking. Nevertheless she loved
      the lover better. I know of nothing more noble than for a man to marry the
      woman he loves, and to raise her by the force of his love; he could teach
      her, instruct her. Nellie will never forget me. I gave her a religion, I
      taught her and explained to her the whole of the Catholic faith&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you won't try to convert my sisters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do pull me up so! Don't you understand that I was very young then? I
      was only twenty, not much more; besides, I was engaged to Nellie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come back to what we were talking about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I have said that if you love her I believe you are quite right to
      marry her. But do you love her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do; how many times more do you want me to say I do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of <i>course</i> if you are going to be rude&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;you understand what I mean, don't you? I am very fond of the
      missis; if I weren't I shouldn't marry, that goes without saying, but one
      likes to have things settled. I have been with her now more thantwo years.
      I've thought it out. There's nothing like having things settled. I'm sure
      I'm right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young men looked at each other in silence&mdash;Frank quite at a loss;
      he could nowise enter into the feelings of a man whom an undue sense of
      order and regularity compelled to marry his mistress, as it did to waste
      half his life in copying letters and making entries in a diary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why did you consult me?&rdquo; he said, for he came to the point sharply
      when his brain was not muddled with sentiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not heir to an entailed estate, like you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not heir to an entailed estate. Mount Rorke might marry to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is not likely to do that. It is an understood thing that you are heir.
      My father might cut me off with a shilling if he were to hear I had
      married without his consent, and I should be left with the few hundreds
      which I draw out of the distillery, a poor man all my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that is so, why marry? You are not in love with her&mdash;at least not
      what I should call being in love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But can't you understand&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I can't, unless you mean that you are down with marriage fever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have considered the matter carefully, and am convinced I am right,&rdquo; he
      answered, looking at Frank as if he would say, but didn't dare, &ldquo;don't
      let's talk about it any more, it only distresses me.&rdquo; &ldquo;The marriage must
      be kept a secret. If my father were to hear of it I should be ruined,
      whereas if Mary will consent to go on living as we are living now, one of
      these days she will be a rich woman. I daresay my share of his money will
      come to at least fifteen hundred a year, and then I shall be able to
      recompense her for the years she has waited for it. Do you understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly. The only thing I don't see is how I am to influence her.
      You've no doubt told her and fully explained to her what the consequences
      would be if you were to publish the banns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have, but it would strengthen my hand if you were to tell her all you
      know of my father. Tell her that he is very obstinate, pig-headed, and
      would certainly cut me off; tell her that he is sixty-six, that it is a
      hundred to one against his living till he is eighty, even if he did there
      would be only fourteen years to wait for fifteen hundred a year; tell her
      if she tells that I have married her it is just as if she threw fifteen
      hundred a year out of the window.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when shall I tell her all this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now. We are going to have lunch at my offices, she'll be there. We'll
      talk the matter over after lunch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, let's start. Come along, Triss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With Triss tugging dangerously at the silk handkerchief whenever he saw a
      likely pair of legs or a dog that he fancied, the young men sauntered up
      West Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But tell me: how do you manage to have so many people to lunch in your
      office; your premises must be pretty extensive?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have the whole house; I was obliged to take it. I couldn't get another
      place that would suit me, and I thought I should be able to let the upper
      part; I did have a tenant for a little while, but he was obliged to leave.
      I believe I am the unluckiest fellow alive. Here's the place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agency for Artificial Manure&rdquo; was printed over the door. Willy asked the
      office-boy if there were any letters, and they went upstairs. The windows
      of the front room were in view of a church spire, and overlooked a little
      shadowy cemetery; and at one window Cissy sat, the little crutches by her
      side, watching the children playing amid the tombs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's your mother, Cissy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the back room cooking herrings, uncle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Brookes was a homely, honest-eyed woman, with dingy yellow hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me introduce you. This is my friend, Mr. Escott, you have often heard
      me speak of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must excuse my shaking hands with you, sir, I have been cooking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is an excellent cook, too. Just you wait and see. What have we got?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some herrings and a piece of steak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that good enough for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love herrings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad of that, these are quite fresh; they were caught this morning.
      You must excuse me, I must go back; they want a deal of attending to.&rdquo;
       Presently she appeared with a tray and a beer jug. Willy called to the
      office-boy. &ldquo;We have no cheese,&rdquo; said Mrs. Brookes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cissy begged to be allowed to fetch the cheese and beer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, dear, I am afraid you aren't well enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am, uncle; give me a shilling, and let me go with Billy.&rdquo; Then,
      breaking off with the unexpected garrulity of children, she continued: &ldquo;I
      am getting quite strong now; I was down on the beach this morning, and
      watched the little boys and girls building mounds. When I am quite well,
      uncle, won't you buy me a spade and bucket, and mayn't I build sand
      mounds, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll see when the time comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, let me go with Billy and fetch the cheese.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you can't go now, dear, there are too many people about; this is not
      like London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cissy had the long sad face of cripples, but beautiful shining curls hung
      thickly, hiding the crookedness of the shoulders. She was nine years old,
      and was just beginning to awake to a sense of the importance of her
      affliction.
    </p>
    <p>
      After lunch she was sent downstairs to the office-boy. Willy sat rubbing
      his hands slowly and methodically. After some hesitation he introduced the
      subject they had come to speak on. &ldquo;Mr. Escott will tell you, Mary, how
      important it is that our marriage should be kept secret; he will tell you
      how the slightest suspicion of it would ruin my prospects.&rdquo; He then spoke
      of his position in the county, and the necessity of sustaining it. Frank
      thought this rather bad taste; but he assured Mrs. Brookes, with much
      Celtic gesticulation, that her marriage must be kept a secret till her
      father-in-law's death. The young men and Mrs. Brookes remained talking
      till the rays trailed among the green grass of the graves, and the blue
      roofs that descended into the valley, and clung about the sides of the
      opposite hill. It had been arranged that Willy and Mrs. Brookes should go
      to London to-morrow to be married. Frank was convinced that she would not
      break her promise, and he hoped they would be very happy. She had only
      raised one objection. She had said: &ldquo;What is the use of my being married
      if I shall have to live with him as his mistress?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A great deal of good. Your position will be secured. Willy will not be
      able to leave you, even if he felt inclined, and you will know that only
      one life, that of an old man, stands between you and fifteen hundred a
      year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want no assurance that my dear Willy will not leave me,&rdquo; she said,
      going over and putting her arms about him; &ldquo;but as you like. I shall never
      say anything about the marriage till Willy tells me. I hope I shall never
      do anything but what he tells me.&rdquo; And she went over and sat on his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a dear old thing,&rdquo; he said, squeezing and planting a vigorous
      kiss on her neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank's eyes filled with hot tears, his heart seemed like bursting. &ldquo;What
      a beautiful thing love is!&rdquo; he said to himself, and the world melted away
      from him in the happiness he drew from the contemplation of these who were
      about to bind themselves together for life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be most careful what you say to my sisters. I would not trust them. The
      temptation to get me cut out of everything might&mdash;I ought not to say
      that, but one never knows. I dare say no such accident could happen to any
      one else, but if I leave the smallest thing to chance I am sure to come to
      grief. They will question you. They will want to know what we did all
      day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll say we sat on the beach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's it. Good-bye. I shall be home the day after to-morrow.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      When the young ladies at the Manor House did not get their dresses from
      London, a dressmaker came from Brighton to help them, and all together
      they sat sewing and chattering in the work-room. Maggie would take a bow
      or a flower, and moving it quickly, guided by the instinct of a bird
      building its nest, would find the place where it decorated the hat or
      bonnet best. Neither Sally nor Grace could do this, nor could they drape a
      skirt or fit a bodice, but they could work well and enjoy their work. But
      what they enjoyed more was the opportunity these working days afforded for
      gossip. Mrs. Wood had the Brighton scandal at her tongue's tip, and what
      she would not tell, her niece told them when her aunt left the room.
      Secrecy was enjoined, but sometimes they forgot, and in Mrs. Wood's
      presence alluded too pointedly to stories that had not yet found their way
      beyond the precincts of the servants' hall, and then the dressmaker raised
      her mild eyes, and looked through large spectacles at Susan, who sat
      biting her lips. Susan told the young ladies of her love affairs; they
      told Susan of theirs; and the different codes of etiquette gave added zest
      to the anecdotes, in themselves interesting. The story of the young man
      who had said, &ldquo;I am afraid that parcel is too heavy for you, miss,&rdquo; and
      had been promised a walk in the twilight on the cliff, evoked visions of
      liberty, and the story of the officer at the Henfield ball, with whom
      Sally had discovered a room that none knew of, did not fail to impress the
      little dressmaker. They talked a great deal about Frank. His face and
      manner called up the name, and after a few hesitations they used his
      Christian name as they did when he came to see them years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a very good fellow&mdash;I don't say he isn't. No one could say he
      wasn't nice-looking, but somehow he doesn't make you feel&mdash;you know,
      right down, you know, through and through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Electricity,&rdquo; said Maggie, with a low, subtle laugh, and her thread
      cracked through the straw of the hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; cried Sally boisterously. &ldquo;Electricity, I never heard it called
      that before; but it isn't a bad name for it; it is like electricity. When
      a man looks at you&mdash;you know, in a peculiar way, it goes right down
      your back from the very crown of your head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not down my back; I feel it down my chest, just like forked
      lightning. Isn't it horrid? You know that it is coming and you can't help
      it. Some men fix their eyes on you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is just when you meet a man's eyes&mdash;a man you like, but haven't
      seen much of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think liking has anything to do with it. I hate it; don't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don't know that I do. I can't see anything so disagreeable as that
      in it. 'Tis rather a shock, a sort of pang.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wood raised her mild face and looked surprised through her thick
      spectacles; the merry niece bit her lips, and strove to stay her laughter.
      Then Maggie said: &ldquo;Sue, have you ever felt electricity?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, miss! I don't think I understand,&rdquo; and she glanced at her aunt over
      the hem she was running.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, come, tell the truth. You mean to say you never felt electricity?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think I ever did, miss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't believe you. Not when that nice young man you were telling us
      about looked at you? Come, now, tell the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, miss, I don't know&mdash;I thought it was very revolting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wood said nothing; with her hand in suspended gesture and her
      spectacles a-glimmer with round surprise, she sat looking at Miss Maggie.
      Her reveries, however, were soon cut short, for Sally not only asked her
      if she had ever experienced the doubtful pleasure of electricity, but
      advised her when she returned home to try if her husband's looks could
      thrill her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think the conversation at all nice,&rdquo; said Grace, who had up to
      the present taken no part either by looks, or words, or laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who cares what you think? You used to be fond enough of sitting out
      dances with him. You mean to say he never gave you electricity?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, never.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I hope Berkins will,&rdquo; said Sally, with a coarse laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      The association of Berkins with electricity proved so generally ludicrous
      that Mrs. Wood, conscious of the respect she owed Miss Brookes, pretended
      to look for her handkerchief, and it was for a moment doubtful if the
      spectacles would preserve their gravity. Tears started to Grace's eyes,
      and she bent over her work to hide them from her sisters, which was
      unnecessary, for Maggie and Sally were absorbed in past experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about Frank?&rdquo; Sally asked, and Susan looked up curious to hear
      Maggie's answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Maggie, staring at the window, &ldquo;Frank is very good-looking,
      but I don't think that he electrifies one... he did once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when was that?&rdquo; said Sally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You remember the first time he came to stay here? Willy brought him down
      from London. We went to bed early and left them playing billiards; I lay
      awake waiting to hear them come up the stairs, and as he passed my room
      Frank stopped and I thought he was coming in. I felt it all down my spine,
      but never afterwards. You see, I didn't know him much then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Jimmy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never liked Jimmy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you don't like him why trouble about him?&rdquo; Sally replied in her
      usually defiant manner. &ldquo;You always take good care to trouble about my
      men. You tried all you could to get Jimmy away from me, yet you pretend to
      father that you never flirted with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't flirt with him; once a young man looks at you you think no one
      must speak to him but yourself. If young Meason asks me to dance with him,
      I cannot refuse; I am not going to make myself ridiculous though you were
      to look all the daggers in the world at me, but as for flirting with him,
      I never cared enough about him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what about meeting him in London?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maggie coloured a little, and repudiated the accusation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You told him you were going to London, and you asked him if he were
      going, and what he would be doing that day. I don't know what more you
      could say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never said any such thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have it from his own lips.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't true; I will ask him to your face if he ever said such a thing;
      I will tell father that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there's no use in quarrelling,&rdquo; said Grace, &ldquo;and I wouldn't advise
      you to worry father about it. You know he can't stand the name of Meason.
      It seems to me that neither of you care much whom you flirt with, you like
      so many young men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is better to like a dozen young men than one old one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shan't marry Mr. Berkins, no matter what you say. However, you can't
      accuse me of interfering in your affairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, <i>you</i> don't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more do I. If you want Frank, take him, only don't come sneaking after
      Charley. I don't want Frank; I don't care twopence about him. If you want
      to see it out with him, I shan't interfere; only don't you come
      interfering with me and Jimmy, or Charley either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maggie did not like the idea of Sally getting two to her one. She would
      have liked to have introduced a proviso about Alfred, but the title Mount
      Rorke slipped between her thoughts, and she refrained. She knew the
      present treaty secured her immunity from Sally only so long as the
      affections and attentions of Jimmy and Charley showed no signs of
      declension, and she was aware that her promise would only hold good so
      long as Frank interested and Charley remained away in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      The canary that had been twittering, now burst forth into long and
      prolonged shrillings. Grace folded up her work along her knees; and
      holding it in her hand like a roll of music, she said that they would
      never hear the end of this tennis party.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see why father should ever know anything about it, he has taken
      that horrid old Joseph with him, he never says more than a few words to
      the footman, and he never sees the cook or housemaid. We have all
      to-morrow to get the house straight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not certain that he is going to stay the night in London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes it is. Don't fidget. Have you got the wine out? We should have a
      dozen of champagne. Mind you make no mistake; '80, that is the wine you
      must get. Jimmy is most particular what he drinks, and Alfred has the most
      frightful headaches if he drinks anything but the very best. I hope he'll
      find the '80 all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's father's favourite wine; you mean to say that he won't miss it?
      Then the port and Burgundy and cherry brandy&mdash;I won't take the
      responsibility.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody asked you. All you have to do is to return the keys to Maggie that
      you took from her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think father will be as angry as you think, Grace; besides
      there's no drawing back now the invitations are out. I think it would be
      better to tell him that we had a few friends in for tennis. We needn't
      tell him who was there&mdash;we will suppress the name of the Southdown
      Road people; and we can take the bottles out from the back. The wine won't
      be missed for a long time, and we will invent some better excuse before
      then. We will say that two bottles were drunk at this party and three at
      that; and further than that we can't remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what about the peaches? There are only a few ripe, and Sally says
      she'll want them all. Father has been looking forward to them for weeks
      and weeks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'll have to do without them; if he wants peaches, he had better bring
      some down from Covent Garden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A knock was heard at the door. &ldquo;Please Miss, Mr. Escott is in the
      drawing-room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell him I will be downstairs in a moment,&rdquo; cried Maggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now off you go, my Lady Mount Rorke,&rdquo; said Sally, who had already begun
      to regret her promises, and to consider if she had not better break them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maggie asked him what train he came down by, then she called the dog;
      &ldquo;Come here, my beautiful boy, come and kiss me.&rdquo; The bull-dog growled and
      wagged his tail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He won't hurt you; 'tis only his way of talking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maggie laughed, and they walked out on the green sward. &ldquo;I suppose you've
      been to a great many balls this season?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know that I have; a few, perhaps. I am glad to get away from
      town. I like no place like this. I don't know if it is the place or the
      associations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are used to much finer places. I can fancy Mount Rorke&mdash;the
      lakes and the mountains; somehow I think I can see it. Isn't it strange,
      there are certain things and places you can realise so much better than
      others, and for no very understandable reason?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that is so,&rdquo; said Frank, obviously pleased by the remark. Then,
      after a pause, &ldquo;Mount Rorke is a pretty place, and I don't think I could
      live long away from it. After a time I always find myself sighing for the
      bleakness and barrenness of the West. The hedgerows of England are pretty
      enough; but I hate the brick buildings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind of buildings do you have in Ireland?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything is built of grey stone, a cold grey tint on a background of
      green pasture lands and blue mountains. I daresay you wouldn't like it. It
      would recall nothing to you, but when I think of it, much less see it, I
      re-live my childhood all over again. I am a great person for old times.
      That is the reason I like coming down here. I knew you all so long ago;
      how well I can remember you&mdash;three dark little things. You used to
      sit on my knee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you find nothing nice in the present?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I do; it is nice to walk in the garden with you, but it seems
      to me you have all moved away from me a little. Grace is engaged, you are
      engaged&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who said I was engaged?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, ha, you see I hear everything. What is his name&mdash;Alfred?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose Sally told you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't tell you who told me, I never betray secrets. You had a desperate
      flirtation two years ago, and the man had to go away, and you promised to
      wait for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't mind telling you&mdash;I did meet a man about two years ago whom
      I rather liked; I used to see a great deal of him at tennis parties and
      balls; he used to ask me to marry him. He wanted me to engage myself to
      him, and I told him it would be much better to wait and see what father
      would say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what did your father say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, he never knew anything about it. You may as well tell me, I know
      it was Sally. I suppose she told you I was very much in love with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She said, at least, the person who told me said, that you would never
      care for any one else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you've been talking about me though you promised you wouldn't talk any
      more,&rdquo; Maggie said to herself, &ldquo;All right, my lady&mdash;very well, we
      shall see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grace is waving her parasol to us. Lunch must be ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maggie and Grace had calculated that if they could limit the champagne to
      half a dozen bottles they would be able to hide the deficit from their
      father's scrutiny; but the servants seemed to be always filling the
      glasses of the Southdown Road people, and lunch was not half over when
      they heard the fourth bottle go pop. Maggie looked at Sally across the
      pile of peaches, but Sally had no ears for the report, only for Jimmy's
      voice. Her head wagged as she talked, and Maggie wondered if they were
      exchanging napkins or rings beneath the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment the servant handed a letter on a salver to Maggie, saying,
      &ldquo;From Mrs. Horlock; the servant is waiting an answer, miss.&rdquo; Grace
      trembled. Sally whispered to Jimmy, &ldquo;What can she want?&rdquo; In a reassuring
      voice Maggie said, &ldquo;She has heard we are having a few people in to tennis,
      and she wants to know if she may send us round a young man; she will come
      round herself with the General some time during the afternoon.&rdquo; At the
      mention of a young man many eyes gleamed, and Sally said, &ldquo;You had better
      go at once and write a note and say that we shall be delighted.&rdquo; When they
      went into the verandah coffee was handed round, and Maggie, as the
      gentlemen lit their cigarettes, said to Grace, &ldquo;Nothing could have
      happened better; father is sure to hear of this, we couldn't have kept it
      from him: now we can say Mrs. Horlock was our chaperon. None will know
      when she came, or when she went away.&rdquo; Then turning to her company, Maggie
      said, &ldquo;Now gentlemen, as soon as you have finished your cigarettes we will
      begin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sally not only insisted on playing, but on playing with Jimmy; and Grace,
      who was striving to struggle into the position of Miss Brookes, could do
      nothing but set the girl in the florid dress and the man who stood next to
      her to play against them. The garden seemed to absorb the girls, but
      Maggie, catching sight of Mrs. Horlock, went to meet her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Horlock was sixty, but her figure was like a girl's. She led a blind
      pug in a complicated leading apparatus, and several other pugs in various
      stages of fat and decrepitude followed her. It was not long before she
      raised a discussion on hydrophobia, defending the disease from all the
      charges of horror and contagion that had been urged against it, narrating
      vehemently how a mad dog had died in her arms licking her hands and face,
      and appealing to the General, who denounced muzzling; but when the mangy
      mastiff came near him he whispered to Frank, &ldquo;I wish they were all shot.
      You must come and see us; you must come and see us; I have a pretty little
      place in the Southdown Road (dreadful place to mention here, they don't
      like it; of course the people there aren't all quite the thing, but what
      are you to do, you know?). Lunch at two, dinner at eight&mdash;old
      Indians, you know. I have everything I want. Too many animals, perhaps,
      but that can't be helped.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you live here all the year?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, all the year round. We don't go away much. We have everything here&mdash;coach-houses,
      horses, you'll see when you come. The only thing I want is a little
      occupation, a little something to bring me out, you know. I read the <i>Morning
      Post</i> every morning, and I have the <i>St James's</i> in the evening;
      but then there is the middle of the day,&rdquo; and, with laughter full of
      genial kindness and goodwill, the General repeated this phrase: &ldquo;I want a
      little something to bring me out, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Forty years of Indian sun! Balls in the Government House in Calcutta!
      Viceroys, tigers, horse-racing, elephants, jealousies, flirtations,
      deaths, all now forgotten, and if not forgotten, at rest; and now glad to
      watch life unfolding itself again in an English village, this old couple
      sat in the calm sunlight of an English garden, relics of another
      generation, emblems of an England drawing to a close.
    </p>
    <p>
      At five o'clock Grace was busy at the tea-table; and very hot and moist
      Sally threw herself into a cane chair. Maggie, who had suddenly appeared
      upon the scene, arranged some fresh sets in which she and Frank did not
      take part&mdash;she having promised to walk with him; and they went
      towards the shade of the sycamores. She had neglected him nearly the whole
      day, and he was vexed with her. But she excused herself volubly, accusing
      Sally of indifference to all things except her own pleasures, and
      impressed upon him that it was her duty to show some politeness to Mrs.
      Horlock's friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sally would play tennis, she played two sets, three if I am not mistaken,
      and she never left Jimmy's side. She took no notice of any one; for that
      reason I hate having people to the house when she is here; everything
      devolves upon Grace and me. It is really too bad. Father wouldn't mind our
      giving this party at all, if it weren't for him. If he hears that he was
      here, well, I don't know what will happen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He doesn't look quite a gentleman, does he? He is a ship's mate, isn't
      he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but it isn't that; father cannot bear those Southdown Road people. A
      lot of young men live there&mdash;quite as good as ourselves, no doubt,
      but they are all so poor, and father thinks of nothing but money. And
      Sally meets them. When she goes out driving in the cart she picks them up,
      and they go off together. Father doesn't know any of them, and he says
      they laugh at him when he goes to the station in the morning. 'Tisn't
      true, it is only his imagination; but I can quite well understand his
      feelings. You know Sally won't give way in anything. Once she ran into the
      kitchen, and told cook to put back the dinner, so that she might run down
      the slonk to finish her conversation with him. Of course father was mad at
      that, coming home tired from the City, and finding that his dinner had
      been put back. You saw the way they went on at lunch, sitting close
      together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were all sitting close together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but not like they were. And all that nonsense with their napkins
      under the table. If you didn't see it, so much the better. I thought
      everybody saw it. I wish Sally wouldn't do it. Father, as you know, has a
      lot of money to leave, and if she did really go too far, I fear he would
      cut her off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she never would go too far.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don't think so; I am sure Sally wouldn't do anything that was
      really wrong, but she is very imprudent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know that I ought to tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promise not to tell any one&mdash;you know you can trust me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she brings people up to her room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't mean to her bedroom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She says you can't call it a bedroom, but she sleeps there for all that.
      She covers up the bed and makes it look like a couch; she keeps birds and
      dogs there; Flossie had her puppies there. That's her room,&rdquo; said Maggie,
      lifting one of the boughs. &ldquo;I shouldn't be surprised if Jimmy were there
      with her now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The foliage glinted in the sunset, and as Maggie stood pointing, still
      holding the bough, the picture flashed upon Frank, and he said: &ldquo;Oh, how
      pretty you are now! How I should like to paint you!&rdquo; And a moment after he
      said, interested, solely interested in sentimental affection, &ldquo;Sally's
      ideas of love seem to me very funny; if she really loves Meason, why
      doesn't she marry him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has no money, and father would never hear of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never hear of it! If I loved a girl, nothing in the world would prevent
      my marrying her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if that's true,&rdquo; said Maggie, and she let go the bough and stood
      facing him, her hands clasped behind her back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it is. What is life for if it isn't to get the woman we love?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is nice to hear you say so; but I am afraid very few young men think
      like you nowadays. One woman is the same as another to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot understand any one thinking so. If it were so, the whole charm
      would be lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So the young people talked, and lost in the charm of each thrilling
      minute, they walked through the shadows and darkening leaves. The soft
      garden echoed with the sound of a girl's voice crying, &ldquo;Cuckoo, cuckoo,&rdquo;
       and the white dresses flew over the sward, and the young men ran after
      them and caught them. They were playing hide and seek. Excited beyond
      endurance, Triss barked loudly, and forms were seen flying precipitately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tie him up to this tree,&rdquo; said Maggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, better take him to the house,&rdquo; said Frank; &ldquo;it would make him
      savage to tie him up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the ninth bottle of champagne had been opened, and the supper table
      was noisy, Frank whispered to Maggie, &ldquo;Did you ever see <i>Macbeth</i>?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I can't help thinking what a splendid occasion it would be for
      Banquo's ghost to appear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maggie pressed his hand and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after the sound of wheels was heard. Grace turned pale, Sally said:
      &ldquo;Who would have thought it?&rdquo; A moment after Mr. Brookes, with Berkins and
      Willy behind him, entered. He stood amazed, and seeing that the tears were
      mounting to his eyes, Maggie said: &ldquo;Father, how tired and faint you look.
      We thought you wouldn't be coming home to-night. Do sit down and have a
      glass of wine.&rdquo; But neither winning words nor ways could soothe this
      storm, and in reply to a question from Berkins, Mr. Brookes declared
      passionately that he knew none of the young men who came to his house.

      &ldquo;Father's just gone downstairs. I think we had better wait a minute or
      two. In that way we shall escape a scolding. Father won't miss the ten
      o'clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bad idea. You are always up to some cunning dodge. What's the
      time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty minutes to nine. I'll slip down the passage and tell Grace to go
      down and give him his breakfast. He won't say anything to her; he knows
      well that since Fatty went to India she wouldn't see a soul if she could
      help it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father never says anything to you either; you tell him a lot of lies, and
      leave him to understand that I do everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's not true; I never speak against you to father; but at the same
      time I must say that if it weren't for you we could do as we liked. You
      don't try to manage father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Manage him, indeed! that's what I can't bear in you, you're always trying
      to manage some one; I hate the word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You got out of bed the wrong side this morning. However, I must go and
      tell Grace to go down at once, or father will be ringing for us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did she say?&rdquo; said Sally, when Maggie returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tis all right; I got her to go, and she said she was always being made a
      cat's-paw of. I assure you it wasn't easy to persuade her to go down to
      father, but I told her she might be the means of averting a very serious
      row.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you said there was no counting on what answers I might make to
      father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was exactly what Maggie had said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well; you are always objecting to what I do, and the way I do it. I
      wish you would go and do things yourself. You think of nothing but
      yourself, or some young man you are after. I wouldn't do what you did
      yesterday. I wouldn't go sneaking round the garden with a young man I had
      never seen before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maggie shrugged her shoulders and went on dressing. Sally, who had taken a
      seat on the bed, watched her. She thought how she might best pursue the
      quarrel, but her stomach called her thoughts from her sister, and she
      said: &ldquo;I don't know how you feel, but I am dying of hunger. What time is
      it now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nine o'clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another half-hour. I suppose he won't start before the half-hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss,&rdquo; said the maid, knocking at the door, &ldquo;Mr. Brookes wants to know if
      you are coming down to breakfast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say that we are not nearly ready; that there's no use waiting for us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I had better go back to my room,&rdquo; said Sally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you had. I wish you wouldn't bring that horrid little dog into my
      room. She made a mess here the other day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I am sure she didn't. Flossie is the cleanest dog in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clean or unclean, I would rather not have her in my room. There she is
      trying to drink out of my jug. Get away, you little beast!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sally caught up her dog, and marched out of the room, slamming the door
      after her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last I have got rid of her,&rdquo; thought Maggie, and she rolled and pinned
      up the last plait of her black hair, but she did not go down to breakfast
      until the wheels grated on the gravel and the carriage was heard moving
      away. Then she begged Grace to tell her what her father had said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said his children were persecuting him, that he had not had an hour's
      peace since their poor mother died.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fudge! Mother knew how to keep him in order. Do you remember when she
      threw the carving knife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sally, for shame! How can you speak of poor mother so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know it is true, Hypocrisy. There is no harm in coming to the point.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was very nearly coming to the point,&rdquo; said Maggie, giggling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what else did he say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said he didn't know what course he should adopt, but that things
      couldn't go on as they were; he thought he should write to Aunts Mary and
      Hester, and just as he was going out of the door he said that he'd prefer
      to sell the whole place up than continue living here and be the
      laughing-stock of the neighbourhood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At these words all looked frightened, even Sally. She flaunted her head,
      however, and said disdainfully: &ldquo;I wonder he didn't speak of marrying
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he say nothing more?&rdquo; asked Maggie, who determined to know how
      matters stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He spoke of Sally; he said it must be put a stop to. I don't know what he
      has found out, but I am sure he has found out something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn't you ask him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did. He said the way you were carrying on with young Meason was
      something too disgraceful, and that every one was talking of it; he said
      that you had been seen crossing the canal locks, and that you had spent
      hours with him on the beach, and he spoke about the cart and Bamber&mdash;I
      don't know if you ever drove there to meet him; I couldn't get anything
      more out of him, for he began to cry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't he speak of the party?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, a great deal. He said that henceforth he would have none of the
      Southdown Road people, male or female, at the Manor House. I thought he
      was going to curse the Horlocks; but I reminded him of the Viceroys. As
      for the Measons, I don't know what he would have said if he hadn't been
      crying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Measons are just as good as we are, though they mayn't be so rich. I
      should like to know who has been talking to him about me; I wonder who
      told him I spent hours on the beach with Jimmy; I met him once there quite
      by accident, and we sat down for ten minutes. I daresay it was Berkins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Sally, don't,&rdquo; said Grace, clasping her hands. &ldquo;Father said that
      Maggie was nearly as bad, and was a great deal too much disposed towards
      young men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think she is indeed; I wonder what father would say if he had
      seen her walking round the garden out of sight of every one with that
      fellow, a man she had never seen before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no harm in walking round the garden with a man, but I should
      like to know what father would say if he knew that you brought Jimmy up to
      your bed-room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My bed-room isn't a bed-room. How dare you make such accusations, how
      dare you? I should not be surprised if you were at the bottom of all this.
      I know you are mad with jealousy. Do you think I don't know how you
      flirted with Jimmy? Do you think I didn't see how you shifted Frank on to
      me so that you might walk with Jimmy to the station? But I'll tell you
      what, I'll not stand it, and if you try to come between me and him I'll
      knock you down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sally sprang from her place and raised her fist. Maggie rushed from the
      room, or, more correctly speaking, into the arms of Willy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the deuce are you up to?&rdquo; cried this staid young man, who had been
      twisted round and thrown against the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, save me! Sally says she'll knock me down,&rdquo; cried the girl, clinging
      for a moment to her brother's shoulder, but as if conscious of the
      dubiousness of his protection, she loosed him and fled upstairs to her
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What damned nonsense this is! The trouble young girls are in a house!&mdash;Nothing
      but pleasure; from one year's end to another, it is nothing but pleasure.
      I am sick of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having by such unusual emphasis of manner reduced his sisters to silence,
      Willy sat down, and chewed with gravity and deliberation. Grace and Sally
      watched him. After a long and elaborate silence he put some brief
      questions, and appeared to devote to them the small part of his attention
      not already engaged in the judicious breaking of his bread. He did not
      answer nor did he comment; and when he had finished eating he commenced
      packing up his diary and letters in a brown paper parcel, and for
      three-quarters of an hour he walked up and down stairs collecting and
      forgetting; finally he left the house with many parcels.
    </p>
    <p>
      As some days are sweet and fugitive, others are obtuse, complex, and
      tortuous as nightmares&mdash;difficult to understand and well-nigh
      impossible to relate. And the day after the tennis party was such a day in
      the Brookes household, nor did its tumult cease when the lights were
      turned out in the billiard-room. It was revived with fierce gusts of
      passion and despair during several succeeding days.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the afternoon both Sally and Maggie wanted to go out in the cart. The
      wrangle was a long one, but the argument of the fist eventually brought it
      to a close, and Maggie was obliged again to shut herself into her room.
      Thence Grace's solicitations could not move her, and she remained there
      until she saw her father coming up the drive; then she ran down to meet
      him, and made a frank accusation of Sally's treatment of her. But he was
      enthralled by his own woes, and without even promising her protection and
      immunity, at least from her sister's right arm, the old gentleman launched
      forth into more than usual lamentations.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had had a stormy interview with Berkins going up in the train, and
      Berkins had so upset him that he had not been able to get through any
      business in the City. Berkins admitted of no equivocation. He had told him
      that he would not allow the young lady that was going to be his wife to
      spend her days feasting and skylarking with a lot of vulgar and penniless
      young men from the Southdown Road. He had declared that it was time to
      settle definitely the terms and the day of the marriage. He had been
      engaged now more than two months, and was prepared to do his share; Mr.
      Brookes must be prepared to do his, viz., to settle four hundred a year on
      his daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea of parting for ever with so much of his money convulsed Mr.
      Brookes. He burst into tears, and their bitterness was neither assuaged
      nor softened by Grace's rather haughty statement that she didn't care at
      all for Mr. Berkins, and was not at all sure whether she would have him or
      not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, father, you may be able to keep your money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But did any one ever know me to think of myself?&rdquo; and he drew his silk
      handkerchief forth. In the new trouble, suddenly created, all other
      considerations were lost, and Grace became the centre of many conflicting
      interests; everybody asked if this marriage so long looked forward to was
      going to tumble into ruin among so many ruins? At dinner Willy seemed to
      consider himself called from the problem of perfect mastication, and he
      said a few words intended to allay this new family excitement; but his
      efforts were vain, for it had occurred to Mr. Brookes that he might find
      calm in a bottle of '34 port. There were a few bottles left which he
      appreciated at their right value. He rang for the wine, and old Joseph
      announced, with all the intolerable indifference of a well-trained
      servant, that the young gentleman had drunk it all up yesterday. Mr.
      Brookes kept his temper better than the girls anticipated, and it was not
      until he had drunk a bottle of a latter-day wine that he seemed to realise
      the wrong that had been done to him. He begged of Willy to listen to him,
      and he talked so vehemently, and cried so bitterly, and laughed so
      joyously, and declared so often that it would be all the same a hundred
      years hence, that letters and diary had to be packed away in the brown
      paper parcel, and all work abandoned for that evening. The next day and
      the next passed in continual quarrel and argument, and at the end of the
      week the aunts were summoned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Mary's features were sharp, her eyes were bright and she sat bolt
      upright on the sofa, her hands crossed over a shawl drawn tightly about
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, my dear James,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am very sorry for you; of course I am.
      I know it is very trying, but there is no use in sitting there lamenting.
      Put up your silk handkerchief and come to the point. We all know it will
      be the same a hundred years hence, but in the meantime you don't want your
      dinner put back, so that Sally may continue her flirtations in the slonk,&rdquo;
       and Aunt Mary burst into a merry peal of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are most unsympathetic, I never knew one so unsympathetic; you were
      always so, you'll never change.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unsympathetic,&rdquo; said Aunt Mary, shaking with laughter; &ldquo;how can you say
      so? I have never done anything all my life but listen to you and
      sympathise with you. When you were a boy and sold my books to the boys at
      your school, and when you were a young man and took my poor husband to
      oyster shops&mdash;you remember the stories you used to tell me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Brookes waved his handkerchief, and Aunt Hester, who was a spinster,
      cast down her eyes and fidgeted with some papers which she had taken from
      her hand-basket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, if my afflictions are only a subject for laughter&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not laughing at your afflictions, my dear James. I laughed because
      you said I was not a sympathetic listener. You used to think me so once.&rdquo;
       Then becoming instantly serious, Aunt Mary said: &ldquo;Of course I think this
      is a matter of great importance&mdash;the health, the welfare of my dear
      nieces, and your happiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And their salvation,&rdquo; murmured Aunt Hester.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I did not think it important, do you think I would have left home, and
      at such a time, when I am most wanted? I always said that that big place
      would kill me, I never wanted to leave the Poplars; a little place like
      that is no trouble&mdash;my greenhouse, a few servants, and just as I had
      got everything to look nice&mdash;I could do it all in a few hours; but
      now I am never still, there is always something to be done. No one can
      take up my work. I am behindhand; oh, I assure you when I go back I shall
      be afraid to go into the greenhouse. I am worn out, I really am; it never
      ends. In a big house like Woborn one is always behindhand. The days aren't
      long enough, that's the fact of it; when one thinks one is getting through
      one thing one is called away to another. 'Please, mum, the cook would like
      to speak with you for a moment.' 'There is no tea in the house, mum.'
      'What! is all the tea I gave out last week gone?' 'Yes, mum. There was,
      you remember, the dressmaker here three days, and we had Mrs. Jones in to
      help. And we shall want another piece of cheese for the servants' hall.' I
      don't know how it is with you, but at Woborn the cloth is never off the
      table in the servants' hall. They have five meals a day&mdash;breakfast at
      eight, and they won't eat cold bacon, they must have it hot; of course the
      waste is something fearful; at eleven they have beer and cheese; at one
      there is dinner; at five they have tea; and at nine supper. Five meals a
      day&mdash;it really is terrible, it is wicked, it really is! You have had
      none of these troubles, Hester, and you may think yourself very lucky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have just got rid of our cook; the trouble she gave us, it really is
      beyond words. She said she was troubled with fits, hysteria, or something
      of that sort&mdash;at least that is the reason she gave for her conduct. I
      knew there was something wrong, I could see it in her eyes. I said: 'This
      is not right; it can't be right.' One night she left the dinner half
      cooked and went roaming all over the country; she came back the next
      afternoon, and I found her baking. Then there was Robinson. Do you
      remember the pretty housemaid? You saw her when you were at Woborn. I am
      sure she must have had gentle blood in her veins; she wasn't a bit like a
      servant, so elegant and graceful. Those soft blue eyes of hers. I often
      used to look at them and think how beautiful they were. Well, she fell
      madly in love with West. Notwithstanding his bandy legs, there was
      something fascinating about him. He had a way about him that the
      maid-servants used to like; Robinson wasn't the first. Well, she
      completely lost her head, perfectly frantic&mdash;frantic; her eyes on
      fire. I saw it at once; you know I am pretty sharp. I just look round, one
      look round; I see it all, I take it all in. I said: 'This is not right;
      this cannot be right. Robinson is a respectable girl.' Her people I knew
      to be most respectable people in Chichester; I had heard all about them
      through the Eastwicks. I said, 'Robinson, you must go, I will give you a
      month's wages, but you must go back to your people. You know why I am
      sending you away; it is for your own good, otherwise I am sorry to part
      with you; but you must go.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Robinson didn't say much, she was always rather haughty, a reserved sort
      of girl; but soon after&mdash;I always hear everything&mdash;I heard that
      she had not gone back to her people, but was living in lodgings in
      Brighton, and that West used to go and see her. I didn't say anything
      about it to West, but he saw there was something wrong. When I told him to
      put the carriage to, he said, 'Yes, mum, where to, mum?' 'Brighton.' I
      could see he saw there was something wrong, and when I told him not to put
      the carriage up, but to drive up and down the King's Road, and that I
      would meet him in about an hour at the bottom of West Street, he looked so
      frightened that I could hardly help laughing; he did look so comical, for
      he knew now that I was going to see Robinson. (Here the remembrance of
      West proved too much for Aunt Mary, and she shook with laughter.) Of
      course if I had let him put up the horses he would have run round to
      Robinson's and warned her that I was coming. Oh, I shall never forget that
      day! It was broiling, the sun came down on the flagstones in those narrow
      little back streets, and there was I toiling, toiling up that dreadful
      hill, inquiring out the way. I found the street, it was on the very top of
      the hill: such a poor, miserable place you never saw. Such a dreadful old
      woman opened the door to me, and I said, 'Is Miss Robinson in?' She said,
      'Yes.' I could hear Robinson whispering over the banisters, saying, 'No,
      no, no, say I am out.' And then I said, 'It is no use, Robinson, I must
      see you, and I will not leave this place until I have seen you.' I went
      upstairs to her room. At first she was rather haughty, rather inclined to
      impertinence. She said, 'Mum, you have no right to come after me&mdash;you
      sent me away; I am looking out for a place in Brighton&mdash;I don't want
      to go back to my people.' I said, 'Robinson, it is no use trying to
      deceive me, I know very well why you are in Brighton; no good can come of
      this, it is nothing but wickedness. You must try to be good, Robinson.
      West has, as you know, a wife and children, and you must not think of him
      any more. You have taken this lodging so that you may see him. You must
      think of your future; this can't last.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed, this life is but a moment,&rdquo; sighed Aunt Hester. &ldquo;I wish you
      had had one of these books to give her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did better, Hester. I told her some plain truths, and she put off her
      high and mighty airs and began to cry. I shall never forget it. Oh, how
      hot it was in that little room just under the slates, with one garret
      window and the sun pouring in. There was scarcely any furniture, and I was
      sitting on her bed. I said, 'Now, Robinson, you must give me back the
      presents West made you, and you must promise me to go back to Chichester.'
      And I didn't leave her until she promised me to go home next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I stepped into the carriage you should have seen West's face. He
      didn't know what had happened; I didn't speak to him till next day. As I
      was going into the garden I called him. I said, 'West, I want to speak to
      you.' 'Yes, mum.' We went into the back garden; I was planting there.
      Edward was out riding, so I knew we shouldn't be disturbed. I said, 'West,
      I saw Robinson yesterday, and I have a parcel for you; she has promised me
      not to see you, and you must promise me not to see her.' 'Very well, mum,
      since you say it.' 'This is a very sad affair, West.' 'A bad business, mum&mdash;a
      bad business, mum.' There was always something in West's stolid face that
      used to amuse me. You should have heard him. 'I don't think she could help
      it, mum; she never loved another man&mdash;I really don't. But I was going
      to tell you, mum, I once knew a servant, a married man, he was in love
      with a young woman, and they waited long years, and when the wife died
      they married, mum.' 'That was all very well long ago, West, but wives
      don't die nowadays.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Aunt Mary talked, realising and giving expression to both the pathos
      and the comedy of her story. Then, feeling that she wasdigressing at too
      great length, she strove to generalise from the particular incident which
      she had related, and get back to the theme of the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know what we shall do, I don't know what we are coming to;
      servants are getting too strong for us. My last cook gave us no end of
      trouble; the butler used to have to lock himself up in the pantry; and yet
      I had to give her a character. Of course it was very wrong of me to enable
      her to thrust herself upon another family, but what was I to do? I
      couldn't deprive her of the means of earning her living. She'll give
      trouble wherever she goes. There is no remedy, there really isn't; I don't
      know what's to be done unless we ladies combine and refuse to give them
      characters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Aunt Mary's thoughts and words began to fail her, for she felt she
      was not getting back to the point where she had entered on her various
      digressions, and without further ado, and quite undisconcerted, she said,
      &ldquo;But I forget where I was; what were we talking about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were talking about dear Sally and Maggie, and the need they stand of
      counsel and help. Their conduct is to be deeply regretted; but theirs is
      only youthful folly. They have not done anything, I am sure, that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so, Hester; of course. But at the same time a stop must be put to
      all this nonsense; it cannot be allowed. I have only to look round to take
      it all in. They are worrying their father into his grave. His position is
      a very trying one. He has no one whom he can depend on&mdash;no one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am alone since poor Julia&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Mary and Aunt Hester looked at each other, and they wondered if the
      terrors of the carving knife were completely forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor James,&rdquo; said Aunt Mary, recrossing her hands, &ldquo;is obliged to go to
      London every morning, from ten till, I may say, half-past six.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am never home before seven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These girls are their own mistresses; they go out when they like, they
      order the carriage whenever they like, and they invite here every one it
      pleases their fancy to invite without consulting their father. I believe
      he doesn't even&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know none of the young men who come to my house. All I know of them is
      that they come from the Southdown Road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be so silly, James, put up that handkerchief. Of course, the
      Southdown Road is one of the great disadvantages of the place. Those villa
      residences have brought into Southwick a host of people that a man living
      in a big place like the Manor House cannot know&mdash;little people who
      have&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not two hundred pounds invested&mdash;no, nor yet a hundred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don't wish to offend them, I'll say small incomes. They are all
      devoured with envy, and all they think of is what goes on at the Manor
      House.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lot of penniless young jackanapeses. Every morning I see them at the
      station watching me over the tops of their newspapers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must understand, Hester, poor James up in London, toiling, not
      knowing what is going on in his own home; feasting and pleasure going on
      morning, noon, and, I may say, night, for when James returned home
      unexpectedly about ten o'clock at night, he found them&mdash;how many were
      there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About a dozen, the others had gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Feasting, drinking his champagne&mdash;his very best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The last few bottles of '34 port were drunk; the peaches, that the
      gardener has been forcing so carefully for months past, were all eaten. I
      returned home unexpectedly; I had intended to spend the night in London&mdash;you
      know I went there to see about starting Willy on the Stock Exchange; he
      has drawn three thousand more out of the distillery; I hope he won't lose
      it. Well, I met Berkins in Pall Mall, and he said if I would return by the
      late train that he would spend the night here, and we would go up to town
      together in the morning. I suspected nothing; I went into my dining-room,
      and there I found them all at supper. Had it not been for Berkins it
      wouldn't have mattered. He was indignant when he saw one of those
      jackanapeses with his arm round the back of Grace's chair; he says that
      such company is not fit for the lady that is going to be his wife; and he
      now insists on fixing the day, the settlements, and everything, or of
      breaking off the match.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why don't you fix the day and the settlements?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grace is not willing; she is quite undecided. She says she doesn't know
      whether she will have him or not. Sally tries to set her against him; she
      laughs at him, says he is pompous, and imitates him. Of course, it is
      quite true that he thinks everything he has is betterthan anybody else's.
      She says he is old, and says that kissing him would be like rubbing your
      face in a mattress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; said Aunt Mary, &ldquo;Sally ought to have been a man; had she
      been a man, it would have been all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Hester, who had spent her life in a vicarage, glanced uneasily at her
      sister, and fidgeted with the papers in her satchel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it will be all the same a hundred years hence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, James, it will not,&rdquo; replied Aunt Hester, with unusual determination.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation dropped, and the speakers stared at each other at a loss
      how to proceed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is a very difficult girl to manage. If it were not for her we could
      get on very well; it is she who upsets everything. She can't agree with
      Maggie; they are always quarrelling. The day after the party she
      threatened to knock her down if she interfered with her young man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it possible! Did she say that? Well, when it comes to young ladies
      knocking each other down! Young ladies were very different in my young
      days. It only proves what I said about Sally&mdash;she ought to have been
      a man, she really ought to have been a man. I see it all; I have only to
      give one look round to take it all in one glance. When she came to meet me
      in Brighton I understood it all at once; I saw she could not restrain
      herself, no powers of self-restraint. Her eyes fixed on every man as if
      she couldn't see enough of him; her black eyes flashing. I wanted no
      telling&mdash;I saw it all; the moment a young man went by her eyes
      flashed. Here she was&mdash;'Aunt Mary, Aunt Mary, there's Meason, there's
      Meason, Aunt Mary, Meason, Meason, Aunt Mary.' It is not right, it can't
      be right; and to my thinking Maggie is just as bad&mdash;a little more sly
      perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not dear Maggie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say it is not right; girls in good health could not go on like that. If
      I were you, James, I would take them up to a first-rate London physician,
      the very best that can be had for money. Those girls are highly organised,
      highly sensitive; their nerves are highly strung. They want something to
      bring them down,&rdquo; said Aunt Mary; but catching at that moment sight of her
      sister's face, she laughed consumedly, and, speaking through her laughter,
      said, &ldquo;So-and-so, a first-rate man, I can't think of his name&mdash;he
      will give you the very best advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think if our dear nieces could be brought to understand the sinfulness
      of their disobedience. I have here one or two little books which I think
      it would be advisable for them to read.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Later on, my dear Hester; the best thing that James can do is to see to
      their health. No girls in good health could act as they do; it is
      radically impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose that is what I must do; I don't know if I shall succeed, but I
      will try to get them to come up to London and have medical advice. Since
      the death of poor Julia I have been all alone; my position is a very hard
      one. I have no one to talk to, to assist me, to take my place in any way.
      I am obliged to go to London every day, and I assure you my heart is all
      of a flutter in the morning when I take the train, for I don't know what
      may happen before I return. The girls can do what they like; they are
      mistresses of this big house, they take the carriage into Brighton when
      they like, Sally takes the cart. I have thought of getting rid of that
      cart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Although passionately fond of talking, Aunt Mary would with patience, and
      even with pleasure, cross her hands and settle herself down to listen to
      one of Uncle James's interminable lamentations, but Aunt Hester, a nervous
      and timid creature who talked but little, not only declared that she could
      not bear to hear the same stories over and over again, but interrupted her
      brother with firmness and determination. Indeed, it was only on occasion
      of Uncle James's soliloquies that she had ever shown any strength of will.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We know very well, James, that your position is a trying one&mdash;that
      since the death of poor Julia you have no one whom you can look to. There
      is no use in telling us this over again; it is mere waste of time. What we
      have to do now is by all means in our power to convince dear Sally of the
      sinfulness of her conduct, and so strive to bring her back to a state of
      grace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her spirit must be broken, she must be subdued,&rdquo; interjected Aunt Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Christ is the real healer, prayer is the true medicine, and by it alone
      is the troubled spirit soothed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It being impossible to contravene these opinions, the conversation came to
      a pause, which was at length interrupted by Mr. Brookes, who through the
      folds of his handkerchief declared again that it would be all the same a
      hundred years hence. Even Aunt Mary's realism did not offend Aunt Hester
      as did this un-Christian philosophy; she gathered her strength for a grave
      reproof, but was cut short by her sister's laughter. All the teeth were
      glittering now, and peal after peal of laughter came. Aunt Hester's
      courage died, and her long, freckled face drooped like a sad flower.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now let us hear something about Grace. What about this marriage? Is
      Berkins as amorous as ever? That man does amuse me&mdash;his waistcoat
      buttons are better than any other man's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary, Mary, I beg of you to remember Mr. Berkins is a man of eight
      thousand a-year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He may make eight thousand a-year, but he has very little money
      invested,&rdquo; said Aunt Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; Mr. Brookes replied reflectively, and he was about to rush
      off into a long financial statement when his sister, who already regretted
      her joke, checked him with an abrupt question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear James, is this marriage to be or not to be? That is what I want
      to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really can't say, Mary; Sally has contrived to upset her sister; she
      would have been, I feel sure, glad to marry Mr. Berkins if she had not
      been upset by Sally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upset by Sally, what do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you that Sally tries to turn Berkins into ridicule, laughs at his
      beard among other things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must see Grace about this,&rdquo; said Aunt Mary; &ldquo;you must excuse my
      laughing, but Sally is often very droll.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Choosing the first occasion when Maggie and Sally were absent from the
      room, Aunt Mary said, &ldquo;Come, Gracie, dear, tell me about this marriage. I
      hear that your mind is not made up&mdash;that you are not at all decided.
      This is not acting fairly towards your father. You are placing him in a
      very false position.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think so, aunty. No one, so far as I can make out, is either
      decided or satisfied. Mr. Berkins is not satisfied with the society we
      see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Southdown Road you mean,&rdquo; interrupted Mr. Brookes, &ldquo;and very
      properly, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And father and he cannot agree upon money matters, and I don't like a
      beard&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never objected to a beard until Sally put you against it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I did, father; I always told you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind the beard, tell me about the money matters that your father
      and Mr. Berkins can't agree upon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Berkins has offered to settle twelve thousand pounds upon me if
      father will settle the same amount. But father won't agree to this; he
      wants Mr. Berkins to settle twelve, but does not want to settle more than
      seven himself upon me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this so, James?&rdquo; asked Aunt Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Brookes avoided answering the question, and entered into a long and
      garrulous statement concerning himself and his money: he had made it all
      himself! he spoke of his investments with pride, and pathetically declared
      that he would not marry again because he would not deprive his dear
      children of anything. Aunt Mary crossed her hands over her shawl, and set
      herself to listen to the old gentleman's rigmarole. Aunt Hester tried
      several times to cut him short, but this time he would not be silenced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Aunt Mary started the story of a girl whom she had known intimately
      in early life, which she no doubt thought would help Grace to a better
      comprehension of her difficulties; but the dear lady lost herself in the
      domestic entanglement of many families, on the subject of which she
      contributed much curious information, without, however, elucidating the
      matter in hand. She wandered so far that at length all hope of return
      became impossible, and she was obliged to pull up suddenly and ask what
      she had been talking about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was I talking about, James; you have been listening to me&mdash;what
      was I talking about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Brookes made no attempt to give the information necessary for the
      blending of her many narratives, and she was forced to seek unaided for
      the lost thread. Soon after the girls came in with their gin and water.
      They drank their grog, kissed their relations, and retired to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the next evening, and the next, and the next, so long as Aunt Mary and
      Aunt Hester remained at the Manor House, the evenings passed in a similar
      fashion; and, notwithstanding the doleful faces they occasionally assumed,
      they found pleasure in lamenting the follies of the young people. The same
      stories were told, almost the same words were uttered. The only malcontent
      was Willy. He had no interest in his sisters, and the hours after dinner
      in the billiard-room when his sisters were in the drawing-room were those
      he devoted to looking through his letters and filling up his diary; so
      when Sally's name was mentioned he caught at his short crisp hair and
      gnashed his teeth.

    <h2>
      VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow, just as I'm settling down to do some work, Aunt Mary
      comes along the passage; I know her step so well. And then it begins, the
      old story that I have heard twenty times before, all over again. You have
      no idea how worrying it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frank laughed, and talked of something else. These discussions of Sally's
      character and general behaviour did not appeal to him in either a comic or
      serious light, and the havoc they made of Willy's business hours did not
      perceptibly move him; he was full of his good looks, his clothes, his
      affections, his bull-dog, and the fact that his youth was going by, as it
      should go by, among girls, in an old English village, in a garden by the
      sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Mary was a woman that a rarer young man would have been attracted by;
      indeed the delicacy of a young man may be tested by the sympathy he may
      feel for women when age has drawn a veil over, and put sexual promptings
      aside. Her bright teeth and eyes, the winsome little face, so glad, would
      have at once charmed and led any young man not so brutally young as Frank
      Escott. It would have pleased another to watch her, to wait on her, to
      listen to her rambling stories all so full of laughter and the sunshine of
      kindness and homely wit; it would have pleased him to note that she was
      gratified by the admiration of a young man; it would please him to hear
      himself called by his Christian name, while he must address her as Mrs.
      So-and-so, and in maintaining this difference they would both become
      conscious of pleasing restraint.
    </p>
    <p>
      His comprehension of life was invariably a sentimental one, so the aunts
      were to him merely middle-aged women&mdash;uninteresting, and useful only
      so far as their efforts contributed to render the lives of young people
      easy and pleasurable. In abrupt and passing impressions he concluded that
      Aunt Mary was bright and pleasant, but tediously voluble, given to wasting
      that time which he would have liked to spend talking to the young ladies
      of poetry and Italy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He scorned poor Aunt Hester. She shrank from him, frightened by his harsh,
      blunt manners; she was afraid he led a sinful life in London. Aunt Mary
      had few doubts on the subject, and her comments made her sister tremble.
      She spoke of him as a most desirable husband for Maggie. &ldquo;He will be a
      peer, my dear James. Lord Mount Rorke will never marry again. He is the
      acknowledged heir to the title and estates.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the young man went as he came&mdash;full of himself, his clothes, his
      good looks; bumptious and arrogant, effusive in his love of his friends,
      and yet sincere. He looked out of the railway carriage window to seize a
      last look of the green, with its horse pond and its downs, and the
      cricketers all in white, running to and fro (young Meason had just made a
      three, and Sally was applauding). The porches of the Southdown Road he
      could just see over the fields, and Mr. Brooke's glass glittered amid the
      summer foliage. At that moment he loved the ugly little village, with its
      barren downs and all its anomalous aspects of town and country. He thought
      of his friends there, and his life appeared to be theirs, and theirs his,
      and he wished it might flow on for ever in this quiet place. He seemed to
      understand it all so well, and to love it all so dearly. He accepted it
      all, even its vulgarest aspects. Even pompous Berkins appeared to him
      under a tenderer light&mdash;the light of orange-flowers and married love.
      For Aunt Mary had smoothed away all difficulties, hirsute and monetary,
      and the wedding had been fixed for the autumn. The gaiety of the day he
      had spent with the girls, its feasting and its flirtation, arose,
      memorised in a soft halo of imagination&mdash;a day of fruit, wine, and
      light words, and the dear General, with his St James's politics and his
      only desire&mdash;&ldquo;a little something to do&mdash;something to bring me
      out, you know.&rdquo; The pugs, the mangy mastiff, the hospitable house always
      open, its ready welcome, and, above all, the air which it held of the
      lives of its occupants; its pictures of white arab horses, and elephants
      richly caparisoned; the wonderful goats in the field, and the tropical
      birds and animals in the back garden! Above all, the walks on the green
      with the chemist's wife, and the annoyance such familiarity caused Mr.
      Brookes&mdash;how funny, how charming, how amusing! He was smiling through
      the tears that rose to his eyes when the train rolled into Brighton.
    </p>
    <p>
      On arriving in London he drove straight to the Temple. The creaking,
      disjointed staircases, with the lanterns of old time in the windows,
      jarred his thoughts, which were still of Southwick; and when he entered
      his rooms their loneliness struck him with a chill. He pictured Maggie
      sitting in the arm-chair waiting for him, and he imagined how she would
      lay her book aside and say, &ldquo;Oh, here you are!&rdquo; He sat down to read his
      letters. One was from Lord Mount Rorke, enclosing a cheque, another a
      daintily cut envelope, smelling daintily, came from Lady Seveley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAR MR ESCOTT,&mdash;I have not seen anything of you for a very long
      time; you promised to lunch with me before you left town, but I suppose
      amid the general gaieties and friends of the season you were carried far
      away quite out of my reckoning. However, I hope when you return you will
      come and see me. I got your address from Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, but you need
      not tell him that I wrote to you; he is, as you know, a dreadful
      chatterbox, and somehow or other, without meaning it, contrives to make
      gossip and mischief out of everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The weather here is delicious&mdash;perhaps a trifle too hot; and
      sometimes I envy you your cool sea-side resort. I wonder what the
      attraction is? It must be a very special one to keep you out of London in
      June.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Should you be in town next Thursday, come and dine; I have a box for the
      theatre. And as an extra inducement I will tell you that I have two very
      nice girls staying with me, who will interest you.&mdash;Yours very truly,
      HELEN SEVELEY.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some men of thirty would have instantly understood Lady Seveley's letter.
      But age gives us nothing we do not already possess, the years develop what
      is latent in us in youth, and it is certain that Frank at thirty would
      have understood the letter as vaguely and incompletely as he did to-day.
      We read our sympathies and antipathies in all we look upon, and Frank read
      in this letter an old woman with diamonds and dyed hair. He had met her
      twice. The first time was at a ball where he knew nobody; the second was
      at a dinner party. She had fixed her eyes upon him; she had prevented him
      from talking after dinner to a young girl whom he had admired across the
      table during dinner. He did not like her, and he thought now of the young
      girls he would meet if he accepted her invitation. Lady Seveley was a
      shadow; and when the shadow defined itself he saw the slight wrinkling of
      the skin about the eyes, the almost imperceptible looseness of the flesh
      about the chin; but, worse to him than these physical changes, were the
      hard measured phrases in which there is knowledge of the savour and worth
      of life. He unpacked his portmanteau, and, dallying with his resolutions,
      he wondered if he should go to Lady Seveley's: conclusions and
      determinations were constitutionally abhorrent, self-deception natural to
      him. Were he asked if he intended to turn to the right or the left,
      although he were going nowhere and an answer would compromise him in
      nothing, he would certainly say he did not know; and if he were
      expostulated with, he would reply rudely, arrogantly. This is worthy of
      notice, for what was special in his character was the combination it
      afforded of degenerate weakness and pride, complicated with a towering
      sense of self-sufficiency. Youth's illusions would not pass from him
      easily; in his eyes and heart the hawthorn would always be in bloom, young
      girls would always be beautiful, innocent, true to the lovers they had
      selected; nor was there of necessity degradation nor forced continuance in
      any state of vice. Love could raise and purify, love could restore, love
      could make whole; if one woman were faithless, another would be constant;
      if to-day were dark, to-morrow would be bright. Life had no deep truth for
      him, no underlying mysteries; it was not a problem capable of
      demonstration, capable of definition; it was not a thing of limitations
      and goals and ends; he could feel nothing of this&mdash;the philosophic
      temperament was absent in him. Life had no deep truth for him, no
      underlying mysteries; he did not dream of past times, and he placed few
      hopes in the future; life was a thing to be enjoyed in the moment of
      living, and the present moment was a very pleasant one. He leaned over the
      doors of the hansom resting his gloved hand upon his crutched stick. He
      was struck with the pride we feel when we are dressed for amusement and
      contemplate those in workaday garb; and in these sensations of pride he
      leaned forward, proud of his good looks, his shirt front, his shirt cuffs,
      his glazed shoes; he pleasured in the knowledge that many saw he was going
      to elegant company, to amusement. He was full of scorn for the women
      loitering, for the clerks hurrying, and especially for the crowds pressing
      about the entrances of the theatres.
    </p>
    <p>
      London opened up upon a little black space of asphalt; crimson clouds
      moved over the many windowed walls of the great hotels, the black
      monumented square foamed with white water, children played, and the gold
      of the inscriptions over the shops caught the eye. London was tall on the
      heavens. Regent Street was full of young men as elegant as himself driving
      to various pleasures, and Frank wondered what sort of dinners they would
      eat, what kind of women they would sit by. Then as he drove through
      Mayfair he thought of his own party. He wondered what the girls would
      think of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Seveley lived in Green Street. When he had rung the bell he listened
      impatiently for approaching steps, for he tingled with presentiment that
      he would somehow be disappointed, and he dreaded dinner by himself and his
      lonely lodgings. Nor was he wholly wrong. The butler who opened the door
      seemed surprised at seeing him, and in reply to his question if Lady
      Seveley was at home, replied hesitatingly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her ladyship is at home, but she is not at all well, sir. She is, I
      think, in her room lying down, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but did she not expect me? I was to have dined here to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard nothing about it, sir; but I'd better ask. Will you come in,
      sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Seveley's house was a house of scent and soft carpets. The staircase
      was covered with pink silk, and in the recess on the first landing, or
      rather where the stairs paused, there was an aviary in which either hawks
      screeched or owls blinked; generally there was a magpie there, and the
      quaint bird now hopped to Frank's finger, casting a thievish look on his
      rings. The drawing-room was full of flowers. There was a grand piano, dark
      and bright; the skins of tigers Lord Seveley had shot carpeted the floor,
      and on their heads, Helen rested her feet, showing her plump legs to her
      visitors. On the walls there were indifferent water-colours, there were
      gold screens, the cabinets were full of china, there were three-volume
      novels on the tea-table&mdash;it was the typical rich widow's house, a
      house where young men lingered. Frank stood examining a portrait on china
      of Lady Seveley, it was happily hung with blue ribbon from the top of the
      mirror. It represented a woman inclined to stoutness, about three and
      thirty. The chestnut hair was piled and curled with strange art about the
      head. Above the face there was a mask, roses wreathed, and a swallow
      carrying a love missive, butterflies and arrows everywhere, and below the
      face there was a skull profusely wreathed and almost hidden in roses. This
      portrait would have stirred the imagination of many young men, but Frank
      thought nothing of it&mdash;the theatrical display displeased him, it
      seemed to him even a little foolish. He crossed over to the flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Seveley will be down in a moment, sir,&rdquo; said the maid. A few minutes
      after the door opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do? I am so glad to see you. Won't you sit down? I have been
      suffering terribly to-day&mdash;neuralgia; nothing for it but to lie down
      in a dark room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you are better now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, when I have had some champagne I shall be quite well. Now tell me
      something; talk to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen was sitting thrown back on the little black satin sofa; she had
      crossed her legs, and her foot was set on a tiger's head. The ankle was
      too thick, the foot slightly fat, but stocking and shoe were perfect, and
      these drew Frank's eyes too attentively. Helen noticed this and was glad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you like Maggie the best?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, I like her the best, Sally is too rough. How those girls do
      worry their father. He has to go up to town every day; he is in the City,
      and the girls give tennis parties, and drink his best wine. There was an
      awful row there the other day about the peaches; he had been going in for
      forcing, and was counting the days when they would be ripe. The young men
      ate them all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen laughed. &ldquo;A sort of comic King Lear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so, the girls will have large fortunes at their father's death. I
      have known them all my life. I used to spend my holidays with them when I
      was a small boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you haven't seen them for a long time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I was in Ireland two years, and then I went to Italy. This was the
      first time I saw them since they were really grown up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you say they are beautiful girls and will have large fortunes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I suppose Maggie is a good-looking girl; she is more a fascinating
      girl than a beautiful girl.&rdquo; A sudden remembrance of Lizzie Baker dictated
      this opinion of Maggie Brookes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dinner is on the table, my lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you said in your letter that you were going to have two young
      girls staying with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but they could not come; they were to have been here on Monday. I am
      very sorry; had I known for certain that you were coming, I would have
      arranged to have some one to meet you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very glad you didn't.&rdquo; The conversation dropped. &ldquo;You said you were
      going to the theatre. What theatre are you thinking of going to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My neuralgia put all thoughts of the theatre out of my head. I have a box
      for the Gaiety. We will go if you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The name of the theatre reminded him of Lizzie Baker, and he compared the
      pale, refined face of the bar girl with the over-coloured woman&mdash;his
      hostess. He had not seen Lizzie for a long time. Why had he not gone to
      the bar room the last time he was in London?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have not answered me&mdash;would you like to go to the Gaiety?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure I beg your pardon,&rdquo; and then, in a sudden confusion of memories
      and desires, he said: &ldquo;I don't know that I care much about going to the
      theatre. You are not feeling well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My neuralgia is almost all gone. There's nothing like champagne for it.
      Hardwick, Mr. Escott will take some more champagne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There were engravings after Burne Jones and Rossetti on the walls, and
      Frank stopped to look at them as he followed Lady Seveley upstairs. She
      went straight to the piano.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you fond of music?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; there is nothing I like more than fiddling at the piano.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then do play something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, not for worlds. I only strum, I don't know my notes. I strum on
      the piano as I strum on the violin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you play the violin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't call it playing, I was never taught.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you learn, then? It is a most difficult instrument; I couldn't
      get on with it at all; I will get mine out if you will play something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you promise not to laugh, I will try, but I assure you I know nothing
      about it. I borrowed a violin once, and I taught myself to play a tune;
      then I bought a violin, and I amuse myself when I am alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How very clever of you. There, you will find it under the piano behind
      that music; do play something, it will be so good of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall I play?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frank had no knowledge of the instrument, but his ear was exquisitely just
      and appreciative; his artistic desire was febrile and foolish, but you
      thought less of this in his music than in his painting and poetry. His
      soul went out in the strain of melody sentimentally; and it leaned him in
      varying and beautiful attitudes. The sweeping, music-evoking arm was
      beautiful to behold, and the music seemed to cry for love; all about him
      was shadow; only the light fell on the long throat, so like a fruit to the
      eye; the charm was enervating and nervous. Helen looked at him again, and
      shuddering, she rose from the piano.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you break off like that for? Was I playing so badly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no&mdash;come and sit down here, come and sit by me. I want you to
      talk to me.&rdquo; She stretched herself in a low wicker chair by the open
      window. There was a church opposite, the painted panes were now full of
      mitre and alb, and the vague tumult of the service came in contrast with
      the summer murmur of London and the light of the evening skies. The
      woman's body moved beneath the silk, and the faint odour of her person
      dilated the nostrils of the young man. &ldquo;Talk to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know what to talk to you about. You would not care for my
      conversation any more than you do for my music&mdash;one is as bad as the
      other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, pray&mdash;I assure you&mdash;I would not have you think that, no.&rdquo;
       Helen made a movement as if she were going to lay her hand on his arm;
      checking herself, she said: &ldquo;I do not think your playing bad; on the
      contrary, perhaps I think it too good. How shall I explain? There are
      times when I cannot bear music; the pleasure it brings is too near, too
      intense, too near to pain; and that 'Chanson d'Eglise' seems to bear away
      your very brain; you play it with such fervour, on the violin each phrase
      tears the soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is so religious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that is just it; no sen&mdash;no; well, there is no other word; no
      sensuality is so terrible as religious sensuality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know what you mean. I can understand any one saying that
      Offenbach is sensual, but I don't see how the term can be applied to a
      hymn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not to a hymn, although&mdash;but 'La Chanson d'Eglise' is not a
      hymn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her arm hung along the chair, the flesh showing through the silk as soft
      as a flower. He might take it in his hands and bear it to his lips and
      kiss it; he might lean and loll and kiss her. He wondered if he might dare
      it; but her air of ladyhood was so marked that it seemed impossible that
      she would not resent. He could not quite realise what her looks and words
      would be afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not wish to flatter you, but I think you play beautifully. I do not
      mean to say that I have never heard any one play the violin better&mdash;that
      would be ridiculous. Your playing is full of emotion. That lovely passage
      thrilled me; I do not know why, nor can I exactly explain my feeling&mdash;nerves
      perhaps. Now I come to think of it I am ashamed. It was the summer
      evening, the perfume of those flowers; it was&mdash;&rdquo; Helen fixed her eyes
      on Frank, as if she would like to say, &ldquo;It was you.&rdquo; With a sigh she said:
      &ldquo;It was the music.&rdquo; Then as if she feared she was showing too plainly what
      was passing in her mind, she said: &ldquo;But it is nearly nine o'clock. Perhaps
      you would like to go to the theatre, the ticket for the box is on the
      table. I should not be more than a few minutes changing my dress. Would
      you like to go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't much mind, just as you like. I heard that the new burlesque was
      very amusing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then let us go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both regretted their words; and, embarrassed, each waited for the other to
      say No, let us stay here, it is far sweeter here. But it was difficult to
      draw back now without avowal. Helen had rung for her maid. She put on a
      white satin. Her opera cloak was edged with deep soft fur, and she came
      into the room putting on her long tan gloves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you ever in love?&rdquo; Helen asked, and she leaned back behind the
      curtain of the box out of sight of the audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I have been in love; but why do you ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It just occurred to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never been in love with a ballet girl, if you mean that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In blue tights and symmetrical rows the legs of the chorus ladies were
      arranged about the stage; the low comedians cracked jokes close to the
      footlights; the stalls laughed, the pit applauded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven't you? Is that really so? I shouldn't think it would be nice. And
      yet, if all we hear is true, young men do make love to low women; I'm not
      speaking now of ballet girls, but of cooks and housemaids. A lady, a
      friend of mine, cannot keep a housemaid under fifty in her house on
      account of her son, and she sent him to Eton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know; I have heard of such things, but I never could understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad. But you say you have been in love. Tell me all about it. I
      want to know. What was she like? Was she fair or dark?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fair. She used to wear a Gainsborough hat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you like those great hats?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did on her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose she was tall, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she was short.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I don't see how she would wear a Gainsborough hat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She did, and looked exquisite in it too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you were very much in love with her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; we were engaged, and going to be married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why was it broken off?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her father was a brute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fathers generally are brutes on such occasions, and there are generally
      excellent reasons for their brutality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Husbands, too, are brutes, and if all I have heard is correct, there are
      excellent reasons for their brutality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Seveley turned pale. &ldquo;I did not come to the theatre to be insulted,&rdquo;
       she said, hesitating whether she should rise from her seat. Frank Escott
      was constantly guilty of such indelicate and stupid speeches, and it would
      be easy to cite instances in which his conduct was equally unpractical.
      Were friends to speak ill of any one he was especially intimate with, he
      would answer them in the grossest manner, forgetful that he was making
      formidable enemies for himself without in the least advancing the welfare
      of him or her whose defence he had undertaken. With some words and looks
      the storm was allayed, and they felt that the wind that might have
      capsized had carried their craft nearer the port where they were steering.
      Their eyes met, and for a moment they looked into each other's souls. Her
      arm hung by her side, white and pure, could he take it and press it to his
      lips the worst would be over&mdash;he would have admitted his desire. But
      the box curtain did not hide him, and the faces opposite seemed to watch;
      and then she spoke, and with her words brought a sense of distance, of
      conventionality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, did you fall in love with her the first time you saw her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me all about it. When did you see her for the first time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was on the Metropolitan Railway. We were in the same carriage, she sat
      opposite to me; for some time we were alone, and I thought of speaking to
      her, but was afraid of offending her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you always afraid of offending people?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know&mdash;I don't think I am.&rdquo; Then it struck him that she was
      alluding to his rudeness, which she declared she had forgiven, and he
      said: &ldquo;I am sure I can't do more, I told you I was sorry&mdash;that I did
      not mean&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, never mind, that is forgiven; tell me about her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A little perplexed, he continued: &ldquo;She was dressed in white, and her face
      was like a flower under the great hat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is clear that you can admire no one who doesn't wear a Gainsborough
      hat. What will you do now that they have gone out of fashion? I am sure I
      can't gratify you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wondered where she was going. I wished I was going to the same house, I
      imagined what it would be like, and so the time went till we got to
      Kensington. She turned to the right, so did I; I hoped she did not think I
      was following her&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were both going to the same house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. There were some carnations behind her in a vase, and you know how I
      love the perfume of a carnation&mdash;so did she. She told me of the
      flowers they had in their cottage at Maidenhead. I love the river, so did
      she, and we spoke of the river all the afternoon. And when the season was
      over I went up to Maidenhead too. I had my boat there (I must show you my
      boat one of these days, one of the prettiest boats on the river). We used
      to go out together, and, tying the boat under an alder, I used to read her
      Browning. Oh, it was a jolly time.&rdquo; The conversation came to a pause, then
      Frank said &ldquo;Were you ever in love?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With your husband?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I was not in love with my husband, he was twenty years older than I.
      When I was eighteen I was very much in love with a young fellow who used
      to come to play croquet at our place. But my parents wouldn't hear of it.
      I was not at all strong when I was a girl; they said I wouldn't live, so I
      didn't care what became of me. Lord Seveley admired me; it was a very good
      match, I was anxious to get away from home, so I married him. You are
      quite wrong in supposing I treated him badly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, don't say any more about that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We had rows, it is true; he said horrible things about my mother, and I
      wouldn't stand that, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What things?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I can't tell you&mdash;no matter. Once I said that I wouldn't have
      married him only I thought I was going to die. He never forgave me that.
      It was, I admit, a foolish thing to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment the curtain came down, and the young men moved out of the
      stalls. &ldquo;There are two men I know,&rdquo; she said, fixing her glass. &ldquo;Do you
      see them? The elder of the two is Harding, the novelist, the other is Mr.
      Fletcher, an Irishman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know Fletcher&mdash;or, rather, I know of him. His father was a
      shopkeeper in Gort, the nearest town to Mount Rorke Castle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a journalist, isn't he? I hear he is doing pretty well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In London, I know, you associate with that class, but in Ireland we
      wouldn't think of knowing them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you were more liberal-minded than that. If they come up here,
      what shall I do? I mustn't introduce you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't mind being introduced. I should like to know Harding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't introduce you to Harding and not to his friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't mind being introduced to Fletcher; I'll bow and slink off to
      smoke a cigarette. Is it true what they say about him, that he is
      irresistible, that no woman can resist him? I don't think he is
      good-looking&mdash;a good figure, that's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has the most lovely hands and teeth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see; perhaps you are in love with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A knock came at the door; the young men entered. Lady Seveley introduced
      them to Frank; he bowed coldly, and addressed Harding. But Lady Seveley
      said: &ldquo;O Mr. Harding, I want to speak to you about your last novel; I have
      just finished reading it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of this piece?&rdquo; Fletcher asked Escott, in a hesitating
      and conciliatory manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid he will not be able to tell you; he hasn't ceased talking
      since we came into the theatre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have done the same had I been in his place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Seveley smiled, Frank thought the words presumptuous. &ldquo;Who the devil
      would care to hear you talk&mdash;and that filthy accent.&rdquo; And at that
      moment he remembered Lizzie Baker. Fletcher and Harding were now speaking
      to Lady Seveley, and taking advantage of the circumstance he slipped out,
      and, lighting a cigarette, entered the bar room. Behind the counter the
      young ladies stood in single file, and through odours of cigarettes and
      whisky their voices called &ldquo;One coffee in order,&rdquo; and the cry was passed
      on till it reached the still-room. Frank remembered having read a
      description of the place somewhere, he thought for a moment, and then he
      remembered that it was in one of Harding's novels. He could detect no
      difference in the loafers that leaned over the counter talking to the
      barmaids; they were dingy and dull, whereas the young men from the stalls
      of the theatre were black and white and clean; but the keenest eye could
      note nothing further, and a closer inspection showed that even a first
      division rested on no deeper basis than the chance of evening dress.
      Civilisation has given us all one face and mind. He walked to where Lizzie
      was serving; soldiers were ordering drinks of her, so he was obliged to
      apply to the next girl to her for his brandy and soda. He drank slowly,
      hoping her admirers would leave her, but one soldier was stationery, and
      this spot of red grew singularly offensive in Frank's eyes, from the
      clumsy, characterless boots, to the close-clipped hair set off with the
      monotonously jaunty cap. The man sprawled over the counter drinking a
      glass of porter. Frank tried to listen to what he was saying. Lizzie
      smiled, showing many beautifully shaped teeth, so beautifully shaped that
      they looked like sculpture. Behind her there were shelves charged with
      glasses and bottles, gilt elephants, and obelisks, a hideous decoration;
      she passed up and down with cups of coffee, she filled glasses from
      various taps, she saluted Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you this evening? Come to see the piece again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get along; I don't believe you,&rdquo; she said, and she passed back to her
      place, and continued talking to the soldier as steadily as her many
      occupations would allow her.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few moments after the bell rang, and Frank went upstairs annoyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, so it is you; you have come back,&rdquo; said Helen, turning; &ldquo;sit down
      here. Nellie Farren has just sung such an exquisitely funny song; they
      have encored it; just listen to it, do,&rdquo; and Helen fixed her opera glass
      on the actress. The light and shadow played about her neck andarm in
      beautiful variations, but noticing nothing, Frank leaned forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't it funny; isn't it delightfully funny?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is funny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having heard one song they listened to the rest of the act. &ldquo;Now give me
      my cloak. Thank you, and now give me your arm.&rdquo; Frank complied. &ldquo;You will
      come home to Green Street with me, and have some supper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid, I am sorry I can't; I must get home early to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have a key, you surely can get in at any hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but I am afraid&mdash;the fact is I am dreadfully tired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, just as you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then at the end of an irritating silence, &ldquo;I am afraid you will have to
      wait, I do not think I shall be able to get your carriage yet awhile; in a
      few minutes this crowd will disperse. No use getting crushed to death!
      What became of Harding and Fletcher? Did they remain long with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not very, they went away just before you came. There is Mr. Harding.
      How did you like the piece, Mr. Harding?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always enjoy these pieces, they are so conscientiously illiterate; what
      I can't bear is unconscientious illiterateness. Nellie Farren has caught
      something of the jangle of modern life; she has something of the freshness
      of the music-hall about her that appeals to me very sharply.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you like music-halls? I have always heard they were so vulgar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vulgarity is surely preferable to popularity. The theatre is merely
      popular.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While Harding was thus exerting himself with epigram, Fletcher stood tall
      and slender, with a grey overcoat hanging over his arm, and his intense
      eyes fixed on Lady Seveley. His gaze troubled her, and when he withdrew
      his eyes she looked at him, anticipant and fearing. He spoke to her until
      Frank, feeling that he was receding out of all interest and attention,
      said abruptly, &ldquo;If you will come now, Lady Seveley, I think I shall be
      able to get you your carriage. May I see you home?&rdquo; he said, holding the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No thank you, I will not take you out of your way. Go home at once and
      get rested, and come and see me one of these days; don't forget.&rdquo; Lady
      Seveley smiled, but Frank felt that she was annoyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if she wanted me to go home with her. That impertinent brute
      Fletcher daring to come up to speak to us! I was very nearly telling him
      to go and fetch the carriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pushed open the swinging doors with violence, nearly upsetting the fat
      porter. The bar was nearly empty, and he found Lizzie disengaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look very vexed. Has any one been pinching you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not vexed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will you have to put you straight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that is a question. Let me see. I don't care about another brandy
      and soda, and if I have coffee it may keep me awake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have half milk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well.&rdquo; He hesitated, but the inclination to speak soon overpowered
      him. &ldquo;I call it bad form, when you are with a lady for another fellow to
      come up and speak to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three of Irish, miss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, didn't he know her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course he knew her, but that doesn't give him a right to come up and
      enter into a long conversation when I am with her. I wish I had knocked
      him down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He might have knocked you down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A glass of bitter, miss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have had to take my chance of that. In London people don't seem
      to me to mind whom they speak to&mdash;a low-bred Irishman, who never
      spoke to a lady until he left his own country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! what a rage we are in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I am not in a rage,&rdquo; said Frank, who at that moment felt the folly of
      these confidences. &ldquo;I don't care a hang. It isn't as if it were a woman I
      cared about. Had it been you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get along, don't you tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you I speak only in a general way, and you must admit that if
      you go out with a fellow it would not be nice of you to begin talking to
      some one else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I never do that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, then you admit I was right, I was sure you would; I don't care a
      hang for the lady I was with, but I don't intend to allow any one to
      insult me. But I wonder how you can speak to soldiers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are no worse than the others. Besides, in our business we have to be
      polite to every one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Polite, yes&mdash;but I wanted to speak to you, I came down from my box
      on purpose to speak to you, and I couldn't, you were so engaged with that
      soldier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was here before you; you would not like it if you were talking to me,
      and I were to rush off to speak to some one else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One Scotch and three Irish, miss, and out of the bottle please, our
      friend here's most particular, he would like it in a thin glass, too&mdash;wouldn't
      you, Ted? and if he could have a go at that pretty mouth he would like it
      better still. A rare one after the ladies is Teddy. Aren't you, old chap?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Full of scorn Frank watched this noisy group. Lizzie remained talking with
      them for some little time, and she did not return until he called to her
      twice for a cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How very impatient you are,&rdquo; she said, handing him the box.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were talking to me, and you go away to talk to those cads.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must serve the customers, you naughty man. You can't have me all to
      yourself. I believe you would like to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I should. I wish you would come out with me. I wish you would come
      to dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what would the lady say who you went to the theatre with to-night,
      and were so mad because some one spoke to her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you she is nothing to me, a mere acquaintance. I was angry
      because I thought it a piece of impertinence of the fellow to come
      intruding his conversation when it wasn't wanted; but as for the woman I
      don't care a snap for her; never did, I assure you: she is nothing to me.
      I suppose you don't get out much here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are off duty for so many hours every day; but we must be in at a
      certain time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you have got Sundays.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We get Sunday in our turn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When will your turn come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going out next Sunday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you would come with me; I would take you up the river. You know
      the river?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don't know even what you mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean to say you have never been up the river, not even so far as
      Twickenham?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, you have a treat. The most beautiful thing in England is the
      Thames&mdash;perhaps in the world. Last year I spent nearly three months
      at Marlow and Maidenhead&mdash;we positively lived in a boat. I have a
      beautiful boat. I should like to take you out&mdash;you would enjoy it.
      Are you fond of boating?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love it. I haven't been in a boat since I left Wales.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you are a Welsh girl. My boat is now at Reading. If you could get away
      early in the morning we might manage to catch the nine o'clock express
      that takes us down in a little over the hour. I'd have the hamper packed,
      and we would have our lunch up in Pangbourne Woods. It would be so jolly.
      I wish you would come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like it immensely; I don't know if I could manage it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you say you will come, do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lizzie stood hesitating, her finger on her lip. A girl entered the bar and
      whispered something to her as she passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go away now, I'm off duty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say you will come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't say yet; I shall see you again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Frank turned to go he caught sight of Harding and Fletcher. He did not
      see that they had been watching him, and when they called him he went over
      to their table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will you have?&rdquo; said Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, thanks, I could not drink anything more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have a cigarette.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, I will; I cannot smoke this beastly cigar. I do not know why I
      asked for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The conversation turned on the play, but at the first pause in the
      conversation, Harding said: &ldquo;Pretty girl, that girl you were talking to at
      the bar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; is she not? I think she is one of the prettiest girls I ever saw in
      my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Far better looking than Lady Seveley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should rather think so; Lady Seveley is over thirty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The choice would be a nice test of a young man's moral character.&rdquo;

    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you write that this morning, or are you going to write it to-morrow
      morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have not told me which, when you do&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see you are not in a hurry to bring your book out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harding laughed, and Frank was pleased at the idea of getting the better
      of Harding; Fletcher sat with his eyes glittering and his lips slightly
      parted. Who would hesitate between a lady of rank and a barmaid? She might
      be a pretty girl, but what of that? There are hundreds as pretty. He had
      never been the lover of a lady, and his heart was aflame. Soon after the
      men parted in the street, and Frank went from them, fearful of his lonely
      rooms, and longing for his friends at Southwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lunched every day at the Gaiety, and he at length succeeded in
      persuading Lizzie to come to Reading with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Town was miserably Sunday when he drove up to Paddington at a quarter past
      eight. &ldquo;If it should rain, if it should turn out a pouring wet day, what
      should I do? That would be too terrible!&rdquo; He felt the boat alive beneath
      his oars, the river placid and gentle, and all the charm of the rushes,
      the cedars, the locks, and the blonde beautiful girl in the stern with the
      parasol he had bought her aslant. Let him have this day, and he didn't
      care what happened! He wanted to show her the river, he wanted to joy for
      a day in her presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was more than a half an hour in advance. Would she come? She had
      promised, but she might disappoint. That would be worse than the rain. He
      would wait till ten o'clock. There was another train at ten, but if they
      missed the ten to nine the day would be spoilt, lost. Supposing she did
      not come, what would he do?&mdash;drive back through dingy London and eat
      a lonely breakfast in that horrible brick Pump Court? He could scarcely do
      that. Would he go to Reading by himself? The light of the flowing stream,
      the secrets of the rushes and murmuring woods died; nature became
      voiceless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be a pity if she doesn't come. We shall have a fine day, I am
      sure it is going to be a fine day, but we shall miss that train. I wonder
      if I can see anything of her. I don't know what side she will come from. I
      suppose she'll take a cab. Perhaps she won't come at all; will she come?&mdash;she
      promised me. By Jove, twenty minutes to nine. If she isn't here in five
      minutes we shall miss the train.&rdquo; His passion grew in intensity, and hope
      was dead, when he heard sounds of running footsteps, and saw the great
      girl holding her hat with one hand and her dress with the other. The
      torture of expectation was worth the rapture of relief, and he said,
      delighted: &ldquo;So you have come, have you? One minute more and you would have
      been late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, were you going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but the train is. We have three minutes. I'll run and get the
      tickets. How is it that you are so late?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I just missed the train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What train?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Metropolitan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Metropolitan? What nonsense! Why didn't you take a cab?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had been afraid of spending the money, fearing she might not see him
      after all; and out of breath she followed him along the platform. &ldquo;No, not
      in there; I don't like travelling alone with gentlemen.&rdquo; Frank looked at
      her in amazement, and they got into a carriage where an old gentleman was
      sitting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you thought I wouldn't come, you naughty boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I should have been so disappointed. I don't know what I should have
      done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lizzie watched the young aristocratic face; his earnestness drew her
      towards him, and she wondered she did not like him better. &ldquo;Now tell me
      what we are going to do. I had such difficulty in getting away. It is
      against the rules; and the manageress (the fat woman who stands at the end
      of the bar and goes round and collects the money) hates me. She would have
      stopped me if she could, but I went to the manager; he is a friend of
      mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That fellow with the long fair moustache that walks about at the rate of
      seven miles an hour, with his frock-coat all unbuttoned. Harding the
      novelist&mdash;the fellow I was sitting with the other night, said such a
      good thing&mdash;he said he was a sort of apotheosis of sherry and
      bitters. I don't know why it is good, but it is; whether it is the colour
      of his face and moustache&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is very proud of his moustache, and your friend is quite right; he is
      very fond of sherry and bitters&mdash;too fond. I have served him with as
      many as three in an afternoon, and I am sure he wouldn't have refused
      another if he could have found any one to stand it. Oh, look at the
      country! How pretty it is!&mdash;the cows, the corn growing, the birds and
      all the light clouds; we are going to have a lovely day. Shall we see much
      of the country at Reading? Tell me, where are you going to take me? Shall
      we go for a walk in the woods? Are there any woods? I hope there are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The most beautiful woods in England&mdash;Pangbourne Woods. We shall
      arrive in Reading about a quarter to ten. We'll walk down to the river, or
      drive if you like; it is only a few minutes to walk to the boat-house. My
      boat is there&mdash;such a beauty! We'll row up to the&mdash;and that
      reminds me, I ordered the luncheon basket at the best place in London, you
      know; it was to have been at my place last night at eight o'clock, and
      they never sent it. We shall have to lunch at the hotel. Such a beautiful
      hotel, high up, overlooking the river; I hope you are not disappointed, it
      really wasn't my fault. We shall have an excellent lunch, I assure you, at
      the hotel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The miles fled away, and in the comfort and speed of the broad gaugeline,
      an hour and a half seemed to them like a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind of town is Reading?&rdquo; said Lizzie, springing from the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much more than a biscuit manufactory. A lot of red brick pill-box
      looking buildings scattered over a flat piece of ground. We shan't see the
      town. It is a mile from here. Huntley and Palmer, you know&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, we deal with them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Catch hold of this rug while I get the tickets out. Shall we walk or
      drive?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's walk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They stepped along gaily, and they were soon standing on the wharf, Frank
      criticising the boats and the rowing, Lizzie all white in the sunlight, a
      little dumbfounded and astonished. Then he turned into the boat-house, and
      reappeared soon after, his arms bare, the sun on his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You got my telegram? My boat is ready?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, we got her out this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose a lot of people wanted to have her, they all went for her, I'll
      bet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, a good many gentlemen asked if they could have her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to please Frank that he had caused so many to be disappointed.
      &ldquo;Well, get her out, we have no time to lose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man stepped from one fleet of skiffs to another, he caught at several
      boats with his boat-hook, but Frank's boat could not be found. He shouted
      to his man who was sculling towards an island opposite: &ldquo;What has become
      of Mr. Escott's boat? I took her out myself this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to know what is the use of my sending you telegrams if I am
      delayed in this way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My man will be here in a second, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, then, do be quick, stir yourself, I don't want to stand about here
      all day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The assistant scratched his head. Finally it transpired that that party
      down the river&mdash;that party just gone away&mdash;must have had the
      boat. He didn't know anything about it, it wasn't his fault. They said
      they had engaged that boat over-night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My boat let out for hire! How dare you do this? I never heard of such a
      thing; I shall write to the papers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will give you just as good a boat, sir&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As good a boat! You haven't a boat like it. How do I know you don't let
      my boat out for hire every day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No danger of that, sir; I will give you another boat, one that you will
      be pleased with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My boat knocked about by some cad! He won't be back till nine o'clock
      to-night, perhaps. I never heard of such a thing. Which is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That one with the lady in the stern&mdash;the red parasol.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must be caught up, he must. Have you got an outrigger?&rdquo; Assuring
      Lizzie that he would be back in less than half an hour, Frank bent to his
      work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he rows like that he will run down some one,&rdquo; muttered the boatman.
      &ldquo;Confound him and his boat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The outrigger shot through the water; the various craft paused, surprised
      at such furious rowing. Lizzie watched the race, asking the boatman if
      there was danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Danger? No; but he'd better not say too much to that gent when he does
      catch him up, or there'll be a row, I expect. He's going round the bend;
      if he doesn't run into something, he'll catch them,&rdquo; said the boatman.
      &ldquo;Would you like to look through my glass, miss? They'll be coming back
      presently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Angry language was indulged in, but the apologies of the boatmen saved the
      young men the unpleasantness of blows, and, elated at his success, Frank
      handed Lizzie into the truant boat and paddled out into the stream. When
      he had got out of earshot and out of the notice of the boat-house he
      rested on his oars. &ldquo;Did you see me overhaul them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you passed out of sight round the bend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, by George! I had a good pull for it. There are a lot of red parasols
      up higher, and I had to look out for my boat. What did they say about my
      rowing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They said you'd catch them if you didn't run into something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did they? I was wild; and&mdash;would you believe it?&mdash;when I did
      catch them up the fellow began to object; he didn't want to come back, if
      you please. He said he had hired the boat, that he did not know the boat
      was mine&mdash;no proof. I said, 'I will give you proof,' and so I would
      have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was afraid. I began to regret that I had come out with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What nonsense! Done the fellow good if I had punched his head. Well, it
      has taken it out of me a bit. I had to put on a bit of a spurt to catch
      them; they had such a start, and they were going along a pretty fair pace,
      too. It has made me feel a bit peckish, a pull like that on an empty
      stomach; it must be close on twelve o'clock. What do you say, are you
      beginning to feel that it is lunch time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not very hungry, and you forgot the luncheon basket. I ought to have
      reminded you to get some sandwiches at the railway station.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sandwiches! I don't want sandwiches; I want something more substantial
      than sandwiches. I'll paddle on; we aren't more than a tenminutes' paddle
      from the 'Roebuck,' a ripping nice hotel, I can tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn't we have something to eat without going to an hotel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think so. I want a bottle of fizz, and the fizz there is
      excellent; one of the best hotels on the river; splendid gardens and
      tennis grounds, a great room overlooking the river; the best people go
      there; sometimes one can't get a table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think I am well dressed enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look charming, a cotton dress and a parasol is all one wants for the
      river.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not ashamed of me, then; you'll take me as I am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ashamed of you! Steer straight for that post&mdash;that's it, bravo!&rdquo;
       Frank shipped the oars, and when he felt the girl's arm laid on his as he
      helped her to land, it seemed to him that all the world was happiness. The
      spirit of the river, the fields and sky, leaped to his eyes. He assisted
      her to ascend the steps cut in the hillside. She laughed and laughed
      again, and stopped to rest. At last they stood on the railway line. It
      swept round another hill all overshadowed and dark with cedars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here comes a train, let's wait. I must see it go round the curve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should see the Bath express come along the broad gauge at the rate of
      sixty miles an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is not an express?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The luggage train came with an interminable rumble and jingle, and Lizzie
      waited till the last truck passed under the branches. Then they went to an
      hotel full of daylight and stained wood, with glimpses of barmaids far
      away, and waiters running about; the rooms glistened with table linen; the
      waiters carved at a sideboard covered with pies, sirloins, hams, tongues.
      Only one table was occupied, and the waiters were lavishing all attention
      upon it. Lady Seveley leaned back smoking a cigarette. Fletcher sat next
      to her, alternately affecting indifference and fixing her with his eyes.
      Harding was voluble and observant. There was about them an air of thirty
      and the dissipations of thirty. And, not in the least ashamed of Lizzie,
      Frank bowed to Lady Seveley; she returned his bow by a slight nod; and
      Lizzie, very much embarrassed, nodded to the men; they smiled in return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is that lady you saluted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Seveley; the lady I told you about, who I went to the theatre with
      the other night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fancy a lady like that smoking a cigarette!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A waiter approached with the bill of fare. &ldquo;We had better not have
      anything hot, we shall lose the whole day. What do you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cold sirloin of beef is excellent, sir; pigeon pie is also very good&mdash;young
      birds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we try the pigeon pie? Get me the wine list. Take off your hat,
      Lizzie, do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid my hair will come down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, so much the better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With some difficulty she extracted her hat from the hairpins, and the
      bright hair hung loose about her white plump face. Frank drank a glass of
      champagne; he was proud of her beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove, how this does pick one up! not half bad tipple, is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They hastened through their lunch, unconsciously avoiding the too critical
      looks of those at the far corner table; nor did they suspect, as they
      descended the hill and got into their boat and rowed away, that they were
      still the subject of conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is no doubt a very pretty girl. He seems very fond of her. I hope he
      won't make a fool of himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think he is 'mashed.' We saw him the other night in the bar. He was
      paying her a great deal of attention&mdash;the night we saw you at the
      theatre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Seveley's face slightly altered. Harding noticed the change of
      expression, and he said: &ldquo;She is called the belle of the bar. Hers is the
      kind of prettiness that appeals to a young man, for somehow, I cannot
      explain, it is a thing you must feel; she epitomises as it were the beauty
      of the English girl; she is the typical pretty English girl; all that
      English girls have of charm, she has; and the co-ordination is an
      irresistible force against some young men; their natures demand the
      freshness the spontaneity, the innocence of&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of the Gaiety bar! I have never been there, but from what you tell me of
      it, it is the last place to find innocence and freshness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may be or not be. We find a rose blooming in very out-of-the-way
      places; but, as a matter of fact, I made no accusation of virtue; vice
      does not rob a youth of its spontaneity. You may rouge the cheeks of May
      and blacken her eyes, but she is May nevertheless. I say that the lover of
      the young girl cannot love the woman of thirty. Her charms touch him not
      at all; but there are others who may love only the woman of thirty, and,
      strange to say, they are only loved by the woman of thirty. The universal
      Don Juan is a myth, and does not exist out of literature. There is the Don
      Juan who plays havoc among the women of thirty, there is the Don Juan who
      plays havoc among young girls, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you think our friend Frank Escott belongs to the latter class?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don't. He is good-looking; he is to all appearance a young man that
      any woman would like, but I don't think you'd find this to be so if it
      were given to you to see into his life. Every man of the world must have
      noticed that there are times when, speaking generally, every second woman
      will run after him&mdash;ladies of rank, prostitutes, maid-servants&mdash;when
      he may pick and choose his mistresses, and change his mind as often as he
      pleases; there are other times when he finds himself womanless, when none
      will look at him, when in fact without an allusion to rings, and sometimes
      a very direct allusion is required, he will not be able to persuade a
      chorus girl to come out to supper with him. He thinks he is getting old,
      he looks in the glass with fear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean to say there are men who look in the glass with fear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, after five-and-thirty the glass whispers as awful truths to
      the man as to the woman&mdash;worse, for woman's youth is longer than
      man's. The contrary is the received opinion, but, like all popular
      opinions, it is wrong; a woman is frequently loved after forty, a man
      never. I was saying that a man often thinks he is getting old because the
      chorus girl took an early opportunity of speaking of rings, because the
      lady of fashion begged of the old gentleman who had taken up his hat to go
      to stay a little while longer, because the chamber-maid did not look
      lusciously round the corner when he passed her in the passage. He looks in
      the glass and imagines all kinds of monstrous changes in his person. His
      fears have no foundation in fact&mdash;or should I say in the flesh? A
      year after the duchess makes overtures, the chorus girl threatens to throw
      up her engagement for him, and the chambermaid pesters him with
      unnecessary questions concerning baths and towels. These facts tend to
      show, indeed I think they prove, that love is a magnetism, which sometimes
      we possess in almost irresistible strength, and which sometimes fades away
      into powerless and apparent extinction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you think that good looks have nothing to do with the faculty of
      making oneself beloved?&rdquo; said Fletcher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The phenomenon of love has hitherto eluded our most eager investigation;
      when we have traced each desire to its source, and classified&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We women will have ceased to take any interest in the matter. What a
      humbug you are, Mr. Harding; one never knows when you are serious. But
      what has all this to do with that poor boy who has gone off with his
      barmaid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This: he is unquestionably good-looking, but I don't think he possesses
      at all the magnetism, the power&mdash;call it what you will&mdash;that I
      have been speaking of. He will never influence either men or women, he
      will never make friends; that is to say, he will never make use of his
      friends. He will, I should think, always remain a little outside of
      success. It will never quite come to him; he will be one of those muddled,
      dissatisfied creatures who rail against luck and bad treatment. I cannot
      see him really successful in anything; yes I can, though, I believe he
      would make an excellent husband. I have spoken a great deal to him. He has
      told me a lot about himself, and I can see that he asks and desires
      nothing but leave to devote himself to a woman, to pander to her caprices.
      All that violent exterior will wear off, and he will yield to and love to
      be led by a woman. He writes a little, and he paints. I don't know if he
      has any talent; but he never will be able to work until he is obliged to
      work for a woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you think he will marry that barmaid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most probably. He will struggle against it; but unless chance intervenes&mdash;she
      may die, she may run away with some one to-morrow, for she does not care
      for him&mdash;he will be sucked into the gulf.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is Lord Mount Rorke's heir; he will have twenty thousand a year one of
      these days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mount Rorke will never forgive him a bad match. I know Mount Rorke,&rdquo; said
      Lady Seveley, &ldquo;and you do, too, Mr. Fletcher.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Unfearing prophecy and oracle launched from the windows of the hotel, the
      young people rowed, lost to all but each other, amazed at the loveliness
      of the river. They floated amid the bulrushes. Cries and regret when
      Frank's oar crushed the desired blossom. Never before were lilies as
      desirable as those that were gathered that day&mdash;that bud, it must be
      possessed, that blown flower must not be left behind. Lizzie dipped her
      arm to the elbow, and rejoiced in the soft flowing water. The river rose
      up into what beautiful views and prospects. The locks, the sensation of
      the boat sinking among the slimy piles with Frank erect holding her off
      with the boat-hook, or the slow rising till the banks were overflowed, and
      the wonderful wooden gates opened, disclosing a placid stream with
      overhanging boughs and a barge. And the charming discoveries they made in
      this water world, the moorhen's indolence, and the watchful rat swimming
      for its hole; each bend was a new picture. How beautifully expressive of
      the work of the field were the comfortable barns. If life is never very
      fair, a vision of life may be fair indeed, and once the tears came to the
      bar girl's eyes, for she, too, suddenly remembered her life of tobacco and
      whisky; long weary hours of standing, politeness, washing glasses, and
      listening to filthy jokes. Would there be no change? If she might live her
      life here! She thought of the morning light, and the home occupations of
      the morning, and then the languid and lazy afternoons in this boat, amid
      the enchantment of these river lands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank laid by his oars, and as regardless as a shopboy of observers, he
      took her hand and begged of her to confide in him. He thought, too, of
      seeing her daily, hourly, of her presence in his daily life; he saw her
      amid his painting and poetry, and this pleasant scenery. Then the vision
      vanished like the shine upon the stream, she withdrew her hands, a shadow
      had fallen.
    </p>
    <p>
      They passed a summer-house where three girls were sitting; one sat on the
      edge of a table and sang the ballad of &ldquo;Biddy Malone.&rdquo; There was a house
      so red, and so full of gables and narrow windows, that Frank said it was a
      perfect specimen of Elizabethan architecture; and he treated Lizzie to all
      he could pretend to know on the subject, and he condemned the owner for
      the glaringly modern garden benches with which the swards were
      interspersed. The sun was setting, there was lassitude in every passing
      boat, the girls leaned upon the arms of the young men, and the woods stood
      up tall and contemplative, as beautiful in the deep blue river as upon the
      pale sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      They landed at Pangbourne Woods by the wide grassy path between the reedy
      river and the spreading beeches. There a man was boiling a kettle. He
      spoke to them; he instructed them in the life of camping out, and he
      invited them to tea. Lizzie went into the tent and got out the tea-things.
      Two men came up, jolly fellows enough; and such little adventures endeared
      and memorised the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      They climbed, oh! what a climb it was, Lizzie's ankles and courage giving
      way alternately; but at last they reached a pathway, and they walked at
      ease into the green solitudes of the wood. It seemed endless, so soft and
      so still. He spoke to Lizzie, whom he now called Liz, of her past, of the
      reasons that had led her to leave home and &ldquo;go to business.&rdquo; Her brother,
      she said, was a painter, a celebrated bird-painter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we should know each other, I am a painter.&rdquo; He told her of his ideas
      and projects, of how he had been to France; he might go there again,
      unless something happened to keep him in England. He wrote a little too,
      in the papers, and he might do something to help her brother&mdash;a
      paragraph in <i>Fashion</i>, he could get one in. For fear of wounding her
      he did not ask if her brother was a decorative painter, employed by a
      firm, or an artist who exhibited pictures. Her father had married again.
      She did not like her stepmother, and that had determined her to go into
      business.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had she ever been in love? Yes, she supposed she had; but it was all over
      now. The last words sounded, and died away in a great abyss of soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parts of the path were marked &ldquo;Dangerous.&rdquo; The earth had given way,
      creating fearful chasms, over which trees leaned dangerously or hung out
      fantastically by a few roots. In the dell below there stood a small green
      painted table, and the young people leaning on the protecting railing
      wondered at this mysterious piece of furniture. There was in them and
      about them an illusive sense of death and the beauty of life. One slight
      push would hurl them headlong hundreds of feet down to the painted table.
    </p>
    <p>
      The silver of the river sparkled through silence and the foliage of June,
      and the songs of the boatmen came and went like voices in a dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      The days of youth are long, and in tender idleness the hours lingered,
      their charm unbroken in the rattle of London; and happy with love and
      tired with the great air of the river and its leafy scenery, Frank fell
      asleep that night.

      VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      One of the French artists he had met in Rome wrote to him from Paris. Why
      should he not go there? There was nothing for him to do in London; Lizzie
      Baker had disappeared, and in the year and a half that he spent in Paris
      learning to draw he forgot her and his friends in Southwick. Nor did he
      remember them when he returned to London; not until one evening, strolling
      down Regent Street, he came upon Willy Brookes suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, my dear Willy? I haven't seen you for&mdash;for&mdash;how
      long?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think it must be now, let me see, I have got it down somewhere;
      when I get home I'll look it up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hang the looking up; better come and look me up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young men laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be nearly a year and a half.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think it must. Where are you staying? I am staying at Morley's
      Hotel, Trafalgar Square. Come and dine with me to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Willy reflected. He stroked his moustache reflectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am afraid I can't. I have something to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! I don't believe you. What have you to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have some cheques to write.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That won't take you a moment. You can do that at my place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn't, I assure you. I must have my books and my own pen. I wouldn't
      write a cheque in that way for worlds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? We'll go to a music-hall afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very sorry, but I really couldn't&mdash;not to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never go in for amusing yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do; but what amuses you doesn't amuse me. I assure you I would
      sooner stay at home, write my cheques, and enter them carefully, than go
      to a music-hall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frank looked at Willy for a moment in mute amazement. Then he said: &ldquo;But
      what's that you have under your arm in that brown paper parcel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Willy laughed. &ldquo;A leg of mutton; I have just been to the stores.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean to say you buy legs of mutton at the stores, and carry them
      home? Supposing you met some one, if we were to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not very likely, a foggy night like this. I have a small house in Notting
      Hill. I take the 'bus at the Circus. I shall be very glad if you will come
      with me; so will the missus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forgot to ask about her, how is she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. Come and see for yourself. Come and dine with us to-morrow. I
      can't give you one of your restaurant dinners, but if leg of mutton will
      suit, all I can say is that I shall be very happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll come whenever you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you come to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. We might go to the theatre afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We might. Be at my place at half-past six, that will give us plenty of
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a queer fish he is,&rdquo; thought Frank, as he walked down Regent Street,
      looking at the women. &ldquo;Can't come and dine with me because he has two or
      three cheques to write, must have all his books out to make entries&mdash;what
      a clerk for the Government&mdash;an ideal clerk! What a genius for red
      tape!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Willy was standing on the steps of the little house, and he commented on
      his friend's extravagances as he welcomed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might have come here for ninepence, third class. You paid that cabman
      three shillings, and you took, I don't mind betting, half an hour longer.
      Now, don't make a mess, do wipe your feet; we don't keep a servant, and it
      gives the missus a lot of trouble cleaning up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not a book nor a picture nor a single flower, and every worn carpet
      suggested the bare necessaries of life. There was the drawing-room, kept
      for show, never entered, barren and blank; there was the room&mdash;a
      little more alive&mdash;where Willy smoked his pipe and kept his accounts,
      but there the crumbs, three or four, seemed to speak of the dry,
      bread-like days that wore themselves away; life there was too obviously
      dry and bare, joyless and mean.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had Frank's mind been philosophic and deep-seeing, he would have mused on
      the admirable patience of the woman who lived here, seeing no one, making
      entire sacrifice of her life; he would have contrasted the humbleness,
      nay, the meanness, of this unknown house with the reception rooms of the
      Manor House; one life wasting in darkness and poverty, another burning out
      in light and riches; timeworn truths float on the surface of this little
      pool of life, and so modernised are they that they appear for a moment
      &ldquo;new and original.&rdquo; But further than a regret that there were no flowers
      in the window, and a sense of the horrible when his eyes fell on a piece
      of Swiss scenery, his thoughts did not wander; they soon were fixed and
      absorbed in the consideration of the happiness that Willy had attained by
      &ldquo;doing the right thing by the woman.&rdquo; He was hers, she was his. Dreams of
      things marital, the endearments of husband and wife, are the essence of
      the being of some men and women, and are to them a perennial delight.
      Frank was such a one.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had brought Cissy a doll, and the child came and sat on his knees, and
      put her arms round his neck. He kissed the long face, hollow-eyed, and
      stroked the beautiful gold ringlets that cloaked the shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went to the theatre in a 'bus. Frank carried Cissy, and he called
      indignantly to the crowd not to press him. &ldquo;Did they not see that he was
      carrying a child?&rdquo; He did not think that his friends might recognise him,
      nor would he have felt any shame had he caught sight of some face in the
      stalls he knew. He would not have put Cissy aside; nor would he have
      pretended that he was not with the pale, worn, shabbily-dressed woman by
      his side. He was wholly filled with his friends, their interests and
      concerns; so complete was the investment of himself that Lizzie Baker did
      not snatch a fugitive thought from them; and it was not until he sat
      smoking with Willy in the back parlour that he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder what has become of her? She was a nice girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean Lizzie Baker? You lost sight of her all of a sudden, didn't you?
      Do you think she went off to live with some one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don't think she was a girl who would do that. By Jove, she was a
      pretty girl! Once I took her up the river, up to Reading. We had such a
      jolly day in the woods and on the water&mdash;amid the water-lilies and
      bulrushes, or the shade of the cedars. I wonder you never go up the
      river.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no time. Besides, I hate the water. I never go on the water if I
      can help it&mdash;I am too nervous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How odd! Oh, we had a jolly day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I never understood how it was you lost sight of her. You said in your
      letter that she had left the bar; but she must have gone somewhere. I am
      sure you didn't make sufficient enquiries. You are too impatient.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did all I could. One girl told me that a lot of them&mdash;Lizzie among
      the number&mdash;had suddenly been transferred to Liverpool Street. That
      was true, for I saw at Liverpool Street several girls I had known
      previously at the 'Gaiety.' Those poor bar girls, how pitiful they look!
      all over London they stand behind their bars! Breathing for hours tobacco
      smoke, fumes of whisky and beer, listening to abominable jokes, the
      subjects of hideous flirtations; and then the little comedy, the effort to
      appear as virtuous young ladies&mdash;'young ladies of the bar.' It is
      very pitiful. In such circumstances how do you expect a girl to keep
      straight? I do not think it is the men who do the harm. There are, of
      course, a few blackguards who crack filthy jokes over the counter, but if
      a girl likes she needn't listen&mdash;a girl can always keep a man in his
      place. Then if a man flirts with a girl he always loves her, likes her, if
      you think 'like' a better word; but you must admit that in the most beery
      flirtation there must be a certain amount of liking. There is, therefore,
      something to save a girl. I feel sure that it is girls, not men, who lead
      innocent girls astray. Those poor bar girls are quite unprotected; they
      have a sitting-room into which they may not bring a friend&mdash;a man, I
      mean. In the bedrooms there is always a lot of illicit talking and
      drinking going on. A girl who has gone wrong herself is never content
      until she has persuaded another girl to go wrong; a girl is so mean! I
      feel very much on this subject. I am thinking of writing a book on the
      subject. Did I ever tell you about the novel I intended to write?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You told me once in Brighton about a novel you intended to write. I
      forget what it was about, but you said you were going to call it 'Her
      Saviour.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that is another book. I was thinking of writing the story of a woman
      who is led into vice. They get her to throw over the man who loves her; he
      follows her, never loses sight of her until at last, determined to save
      her, and although he knows that he is wrecking his own life, he marries
      her. What do you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Being pressed for an answer, Willy stroked his moustache with great
      gravity. &ldquo;I really can't say, my dear fellow; you know I never like giving
      opinions on questions I do not understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The conversation came to a pause, and Willy began to whistle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a little flat&mdash;quarter of a note wrong there and there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you whistle it? Oh, yes, that's it! I can hear the difference! I wish
      you had your violin. I should like to hear you play it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, with the missus overhead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She doesn't know anything about it. How prettily <i>she</i> used to sing
      it; a pretty tune, isn't it? Good old days they were! Do you remember when
      you used to come to the Princess's with me? Didn't she look pretty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never told me why you didn't marry her; I never heard the end of that
      story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing to tell. It's all over now. Do you remember how I used
      to dress myself up to go to the theatre? We used to go to supper at
      Scott's afterwards. I did not mind what I ate in those days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hardly ever go to the theatre now, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hardly ever. I shouldn't have gone to-night if it had not been for you. I
      don't know how it is, but I don't seem to enjoy myself as I used to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The men ceased talking. Presently Frank broke the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you are getting on all right on the Stock Exchange. You haven't
      mentioned the subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know that there is much to say. Times are very bad just now. I
      don't think any one is doing much good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are with a very good firm. Nothing is going wrong, I hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think any one is making money. We have all been hard hit lately&mdash;war
      scares. But I daresay it will all come right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never understood what you ever wanted to go into the business for. What
      do you, with your handsome place at Southwick, and your father with his
      thousands and thousands, want to turn yourself into a city clerk for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, you don't care about making money; I do&mdash;it was bred in me.
      Besides, I am an unselfish fellow. I never think of myself; I like to
      think of others. If I were to make a good thing out of this, I should be
      able to leave the missus independent.&rdquo; Then, after a slight pause, Willy
      said: &ldquo;But, by the way, I was forgetting. I got a letter this morning
      saying that if I met you in London I was to tell you that you were to come
      to Southwick for a ball.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What ball?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A subscription ball at Henfield&mdash;a county ball. Will you come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I don't mind. It should be rather fun. Are you going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I must go, worse luck, to chaperon my sisters.&rdquo;

      &ldquo;How do you go? Will the governor let you have the horses?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not he! We generally have a large 'bus. I am going down to-morrow by the
      twelve o'clock train. Will that be too early for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not if I go home now and pack up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won't like that. You had better sleep here and get up early in the
      morning; your room is all ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn't manage it. I never could get back to the Temple, pack up, and
      meet you at twelve at London Bridge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be rather a cold walk for you; you are too late for the train,
      and the last 'bus, I am afraid, has gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall have a hansom. The only thing that worries me is not being able
      to say good-bye to the missus.&rdquo;

      &ldquo;She's fast asleep. She won't mind&mdash;I'll make that all right.&rdquo;

    <p>
      Sally rushed down to meet him, and she took him off for a walk in the
      garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a time it is since we have seen you. What have you been doing&mdash;amusing
      yourself a great deal, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been the whole time in Paris. I have been studying very hard. I
      only returned home about two months ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't believe about the studying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been working at my painting. I worked morning and afternoon in the
      studio from the nude. Last summer I had a delightful time. I took a little
      place on the Seine&mdash;a little house near Bas Meudon. I had a garden; I
      used to breakfast every morning in the garden&mdash;fresh eggs, new bread,
      an omelette, such as only a Frenchwoman can make, a cutlet, or a piece of
      chicken. The wine, too, so fresh and generous. I don't know how it is, but
      Burgundy here is not the same as Burgundy on the banks of the Seine. I
      worked all day in my garden, or down by the river. I was painting a large
      picture. I haven't finished it yet. I must go back there in the summer to
      finish it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why can't you finish it here? Haven't you got it here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but the Seine is not here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn't the Adour do? The river at Shoreham?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but the Thames might. My picture is really more English than French.
      There were a lot of willow trees there, and my picture represents a girl
      lying in a hammock, foot hanging over, showing such a pretty piece of
      black stocking. There are two men there, they are both swinging the
      hammock, but while one is looking at her ankle the other only sees her
      face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sally laughed coarsely and evasively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you laughing at?&rdquo; he asked, feeling a little nettled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you think people will think it rather improper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all. Why should they? The idea I wish to convey is that one man
      loves her truly for herself alone, the other only loves her because she is
      a pretty girl. I have composed some triolets for the picture, which will
      be printed in the catalogue&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
      &ldquo;In a hammock I swing,
        My feet hanging over;
      'Neath Love's bright wing,
        In a hammock I swing,
      Loves come and they bring
        A truth to discover,
      In a hammock I swing,
        My feet hanging over.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the first stanza. There are six, and they tell the story of the
      picture. I will copy them into your album, if you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you? That will be so nice, if you will. The only thing is, I haven't
      an album.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven't you? I'll get you one. I'll send you one from London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sally asked him to explain the triolets, and very loyally she strove to
      understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I see a thing when I am told, but I never can understand poetry or
      pictures until they are explained to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mollified, Frank thought of going upstairs to fetch the copy book in which
      he wrote such things, but speaking out of an unperceived association of
      ideas, he said: &ldquo;What a clever girl your sister is. I had once a long talk
      with her about pictures and poetry, and I was surprised to find how well
      she talked. She understands everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maggie is a clever girl; I know she is far cleverer than I am; but if you
      knew her as well as I do, you would find she did not understand all you
      think she understands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maggie's cleverness lies in being able to pretend she understands what
      she knows nothing about; I have often caught her out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really; but how do you get on together now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty well! I don't think there is much love lost on either side. I
      don't know why&mdash;I never could understand Maggie. You have no idea of
      the reports she spreads about me all over the place&mdash;the stories she
      tells the Grahams, the Prestons, the Wells. She told Mrs. Wells that I
      fell in love with every young man that came to Southwick. She said awful
      things about me. As for that story about telling cook to put father's
      dinner back, I don't think I ever shall hear the last of it. What made
      father so angry was because he thought it was to talk to Jimmy in the
      slonk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You told me the last time I was here that you wanted to finish a
      conversation with him in the slonk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may have told you that it was to speak to him about his sister Fanny,&rdquo;
       Sally replied evasively. &ldquo;I would not care if I never saw him again; but I
      couldn't get on if I weren't allowed to see Fanny. Father wanted me to
      promise never to enter the house again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you have flirted with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know that I have; certainly not more than Maggie. Last summer she
      was hanging round his neck every evening under the sycamores. I caught
      them twice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see any harm in going under the sycamores. I daresay Maggie has
      allowed him to kiss her; so have you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I assure you I haven't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean to say a man never kissed you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't say that. I haven't kissed any one for years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who did kiss you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't know him. I was only eighteen. He was a married man; it was
      very wrong of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I had been he.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you? I hate him; he was a beast for doing it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sally often indulged in these half confessions; one of her aunts used to
      call them her &ldquo;side lights.&rdquo; By their aid she succeeded in interesting
      Frank. &ldquo;How candid she is to tell me&mdash;to confide in me!&rdquo; Sally was
      handsome now; the evening suited her dark skin and coal black eyes, and
      her strong figure was rich and not ungraceful in a dress of ruby velvet.
      Should he kiss her? What would she say? He threwhis arm about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am surprised. Certainly not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see any harm.&rdquo; Then, with a sensation of saying something
      foolish, he said: &ldquo;You told me you kissed a married man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was ages ago&mdash;I was very silly. I shouldn't think of doing
      sonow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the silence which followed Frank wondered why he had tried to kiss her.
      Decidedly he liked the other better.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now every evening Maggie went to the writing-table, and all knew what it
      meant. Mr. Brookes occasionally lamented in a minor key, but without
      having recourse to his handkerchief. Willy said nothing; his losses on the
      Stock Exchange had been heavy; and owing to a conversation Frank had drawn
      him into during dinner the other day, his digestion, he feared, was not
      quite up to the mark. So on the night of the ball he only answered with an
      occasional monosyllable the splendid young man of the embroidered
      waistcoats who related his pleasures in a deep bass; nor did he pretend to
      take any interest in the crude militia officer who sometimes broke the
      silence by a declaration that he did not care for politics or poetry, that
      he liked history better. The young ladies listened devoutly to all that
      the young men said; Mr. Brookes carved valiantly at the head of the table
      and appeared resigned. Bouquets were fixed in button-holes in the
      billiard-room and the 'bus was announced. A greasy oil-lamp hung from the
      roof. Sometimes Sally rubbed the windows and said she could tell by the
      bushes where they were, and the embroidered waistcoat continued to drone
      out the measure of his amusements. He would have to run up to London, then
      he must have a shy at <i>trente et quarante</i> at Monte Carlo, then he
      must get back for the spring meeting at Newmarket. Frank asked him if he
      didn't think he could manage to amuse himself without talking it all out
      beforehand. But undaunted and unchecked he wandered from Homburg to Paris,
      and from Paris to Ross-shire, until the 'bus drew up among a small crowd
      of people.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ball was a failure. When they entered the rooms there were scarcely
      twenty people present. It was very cold, and the men said; &ldquo;How can the
      women bear it with their naked shoulders?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall never get near this fire,&rdquo; said Sally, looking in dismay on the
      circle of damsels who stood warming themselves, their dresses relieved
      upon the masses of laurel with which the room was decorated; &ldquo;there is a
      beautiful fire in one of those little rooms at the end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, let us come and sit there; or shall we dance this waltz
      first?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's dance it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They danced, and Frank shuddered in his evening clothes as he danced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you notice,&rdquo; said Sally, as they hurried to the retiring room, &ldquo;how
      upset father seemed at dinner? I thought he was going to cry, but he bore
      up to the end better than I expected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he did, but I don't see what there was particularly to upset him this
      time. Meason is away at sea, and you have promised not to see him any
      more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I wasn't thinking about the Measons&mdash;but haven't you heard? I
      only heard it through a friend, but I know for a fact that Willy has lost
      nearly all his money on the Stock Exchange.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't say so; I am so sorry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father hasn't heard it all yet; if he had he wouldn't have come down to
      dinner. I don't fancy he knows more than that things have not been going
      well, and that Willy has been a loser.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how can he have lost? I thought he was junior partner in an old
      established business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he is. I can't tell you how the mischief was done, but I know he has
      lost all his money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by all his money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the money&mdash;three thousand&mdash;that father let him draw out of
      the distillery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is very sad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, isn't it? And particularly for a fellow who has so few amusements,
      and only cares about making money. Just look at him now; he wanders about
      speaking to no one. Come, let's dance this dance&mdash;are you engaged?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This news about Willy fixed the Harfield ball in Frank's thoughts, and he
      remembered the pretty girl in white of whom he could make nothing, of the
      raw just-brought-out girl who had bored him, of the communicative girl who
      had amused him by her accounts of her dogs and horses; he remembered, too,
      how he had seen Maggie disappearing down the ends of certain passages with
      a young man whose name he did not catch, and whose face he had not
      noticed. He had danced twice with her, only twice; she was distracted, she
      did not look at him, her eyes wandered all over the room, she answered his
      questions indifferently. Sally, on the contrary, had devoted herself to
      him, and on several occasions he thought that her blunt straightforward
      manner was better than the other's slyness. The 'bus came with its
      draughts, its sickly lamp and its doleful jolting. Sally was too tired to
      rub the windows and declare how far they were from home, and the dancers
      endured their discomforts almost in silence; even the embroidered
      waistcoat occasionally ceased to talk about Homburg; and in all the
      extreme bitterness and greyness of a March morning they pulled up before
      the door of the Manor House.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg of you not to make a noise. If you wake up father he will never let
      us go to a ball again. Is there a fire in the billiard-room, Gardner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, miss, there's a lovely fire; the decanters are on the table and the
      kettle is on the hob.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you would all like a glass of something hot,&rdquo; said Maggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But don't make a noise, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They stole along the passages to the billiard-room shivering, their feet
      aching, feeling very uncomfortable indeed. The waistcoat was now
      considering if it would be good form to come forward in the Conservative
      interest at the next election; but every one was too tired, they could not
      laugh, and amid a few general remarks the young ladies drank their gin and
      water, casting sheep's eyes at the young men, and then, glad and yet loth
      to part, all retired limping to their rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Breakfast was a pleasant meal&mdash;full of laughter and anecdotes of the
      ball, and, laden with Gladstone bags, the young men departed in ones and
      twos. Frank was going with Willy to London, and when they disappeared
      among the laurels Sally and Maggie turned indoors, conscious of reaction,
      and wondering what they should do with the long day that stretched before
      them. Maggie walked upstairs; she lingered, undecided, and then went down
      the passage to Frank's room. He had forgotten a shirt stud; on the chest
      of drawers there was a crumpled white tie and a soiled pair of white
      gloves. &ldquo;How careless he is!&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;I must send him this,&rdquo; and she
      put the stud in her pocket. She straightened out the gloves and determined
      to send the necktie to the wash. Next time he came down she would have it
      to give him, nice, clean, and white&mdash;she must see that it was
      beautifully made up. Then she found his ball programme. He had danced four
      times with Sally&mdash;only twice with her&mdash;what a fool she had been;
      she had wasted her whole evening with that other fellow. It did make her
      feel so angry. Then the housemaid entered and turned the bed down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a lot of washing there will be this week, Gardner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There will indeed, miss. Three pairs of sheets, and only slept in once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, isn't it a pity? It seems absurd to send these sheets to the wash,
      doesn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It do, indeed, miss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absurd!&rdquo; said Sally, who had just come in. &ldquo;I want a pair of fresh sheets
      for my bed. I'll have these.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No you won't&mdash;I was going to take them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to know what right you have to them more than I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You promised not to interfere with me, and you have done nothing else.
      You did nothing at the ball but ask him for dances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a lie! I didn't ask him for a dance. You went off to hide; no one
      saw anything of you all the evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean to say you didn't promise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never promised anything; if I did I should keep my promise. I am not
      like you. I want a pair of sheets, and I mean to have these.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are too big for your bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sally seized the sheet and strove to drag it from Maggie, who, although
      the weaker, held her own bravely for some time. Finding her strength
      failing her, she loosed her hold, letting her sister fall against the
      wall, and taking up the pillow she launched it with her full force. &ldquo;If
      you want what he slept in, you can have it all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll give it to you, my lady,&rdquo; cried the bully, making a rush round the
      bed, but Maggie fled through the dressing-room, shutting the door behind
      her, and locked herself into her room.

    <h2>
      IX
    </h2>
    <p>
      As Willy would not pay the extra fare, Frank had to travel second class.
      He was telling his friend of the Stock Exchange, and his losses&mdash;nearly
      four thousand pounds. He had suspected that the firm of which he was
      junior partner had not played fair with him. Anyhow, he was going to get
      out of the business, having something better in view&mdash;a shop in
      Brighton. Yes, a shop in Brighton, a greengrocer's shop. No one had any
      idea, until they went into the calculation, of the amount of profit that
      was made on vegetables. Lord This and Lord That, every one who had a
      handsome place with large gardens, counted on being able to pay his
      gardener's wages by the sale of the surplus carrots, artichokes, potatoes,
      parsley, onions, tomatoes, especially tomatoes&mdash;every one nowadays
      ate tomatoes. He had it all down in figures, and was perfectly astonished
      at the sums of money that could be made. Grapes had been overdone, that
      was true; but a profit could be made out of everything else. Flowers,
      especially gardenias, were sold in the London market at two shillings
      apiece. Now, there was he within five miles of a large town like Brighton;
      the rent of a shop in the Western Road would not come to more than seventy
      or eighty pounds a year; the missus he would put in as shopwoman, and,
      there was no doubt of it, she would make as good a shopwoman as you could
      find, after a little practice; the child could run on errands, so it
      should be all profit. &ldquo;I shall have none of the expenses that other people
      have to contend with. In the garden at the Manor House about three times
      as much stuff is grown as required. I shall buy all the fruit, vegetables,
      and flowers from my father at cost price, or a little over, and shall sell
      in my shop at retail price, that is, twenty or thirty per cent more. There
      is, therefore, no reason why the shop should not bring in from three to
      four hundred a year. And&mdash;would you believe it?&mdash;my father, who
      will be benefited by my scheme, if not more, quite as much as I shall be,
      is opposed to it; he will get a fair price for a lot of things for which
      he now gets nothing. But no. He cannot, or will not, see it. I never saw
      any one like my father. He will not help himself and you can do nothing to
      help him. The distillery business is going very badly. He had a bad year
      last year. I know for a fact that he did not make five per cent on his
      capital. Putting these things together, I should have thought that he
      would have been glad to make a little money to retrench; but no! he
      prefers to go on in the old way. He made money in the old way, and he
      doesn't see why he shouldn't make money again in the old way. Odd man my
      father is, isn't he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It appeared to Frank that Mr. Brookes had managed to help himself very
      liberally indeed to all the good things in life; but with his false,
      facile, Celtic nature, he had no difficulty in re-adjusting his ideas and
      adopting a view of Mr. Brookes more in harmony with Willy's. He was, as
      usual, enthusiastic about his friends, and was effervescing with love and
      goodwill. He saw nothing of their faults&mdash;they were the best and
      truest people he had ever known, and he could not love them too much.
      Indeed he was angry, and regretted the limitations that nature has set on
      the human heart, and would if he could have lost himself in one immense
      and eternal love of the Brookeses.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he bade Willy good-bye at London Bridge, and wished him well with his
      shop, these sentiments ceased to be active forces in him, and they lay
      latent in his life of restaurants and bar rooms until the summer returned,
      and he received an invitation from the Manor House to come down for a
      garden party at Mrs. Berkins's. When he opened the letter he basked in
      thoughts of them&mdash;of Maggie and her fascinating subtleties, of
      Sally's blunt speech and sturdy good looks, of Willy, and all the quiet
      talks they would have together. He counted the tunnels, and, striving to
      recall the landscape, guessed extravagantly the number of miles that
      separated him from them. He walked up the drive with a beating heart,
      looking for the girls between the laurel bushes. He found them, and their
      habits which endeared them to him, unchanged; and to slip back into the
      old ways without experiencing the slightest difficulty or jar was like
      waking from a dream and entering again on a pleasant reality. There was
      the excellent dinner and the usual complaints about the Southdown Road,
      the cigars in the billiard-room, conversation about pictures and
      investments, gin and water, and then a long yarn with Willy in his
      bedroom. Life moved at the Manor House without any spring creaking,
      without jolt or jar, and it was this beautiful regularity that made Frank
      feel so healthily and so unexpectedly happy. He loved the desolation of
      Ireland. This was the stronger sense, but there was another sense, a half
      stifled sense, that found an echo in these southern downs interwoven with
      suburban life&mdash;in other words, a faint resurrection of the original
      English mind in him. He enjoyed and he grew akin to this Saxon prosperity;
      he learned to recognise it as manifested in the various prospects of the
      weald and the wold, and he loved this medley of contradictory aspects&mdash;the
      spires of the village churches, the porches of the villas, the rich
      farmhouses and their elm trees, the orchards jammed between masses of
      chalk, the shepherds seen against the sky of the Downs. It is true that he
      felt that this country was alien to him, but he was not individually
      conscious that his love of suburban Sussex was a morbid affection, opposed
      to the normal and indissoluble bonds of inherited aspirations and
      prejudices, and the forms and colours that had filled his eyes in
      childhood. Consciousness in Frank Escott was always slow, and always so
      governed and coloured by the sentiment of the moment that his
      comprehension of things were always deformed or incomplete. In his mind
      the phenomenon of life was ever in nebulae, and though very often one
      thought would define itself, no group of thoughts, or part of a group,
      ever became clear, so there was no abiding principle, nothing that he
      might know and steer by. He was, of course, aware that the Brookes were
      not equal to him in rank, but he did not know, or, rather, he would not
      know, that they were vulgar; nor did he think that Mount Rorke might marry
      again, if he were to marry Maggie or Sally. All that was really alive and
      distinct in him was love of them; and this love thrived in a sensation of
      class which he would not acknowledge, even to himself, had any existence.
      The glass-houses, and swards, and laurels had a meaning and fascination
      for him that he could not account for or describe, and he found these
      feelings, which were mainly class feelings of an unusual kind, not only in
      the aspect of the country but in the accent and speech of his friends, in
      the expression of their eyes and very hands. The English servants pleased
      him, and he strove to detect qualities in the carriage and horses, and he
      compared them to their advantage with Mount Rorke's. He loved to wrap the
      rug about the young ladies' knees, and they seemed to him quite perfect
      and delightful as they lay back in their carriage, driving beneath a sky
      full of blue, and through the changing views of the Downs, all distinct
      with light and shade. Sally and Maggie made much of him, covered him up,
      and addressed to him pleasant speeches. His eyes and ears were open and
      eager for new impressions, and his heart panted with readiness to admire
      and praise all he saw. He was ready to think that he had never seen
      anything so lovely as the laurels and the numerous glass-houses; and he
      wondered why he had ever thought so little of Berkins, and he listened
      with interest to that gentleman's explanation of the superiority of his
      possessions over everybody else's possessions. He even allowed himself to
      be persuaded that there was no pheasant shooting in the kingdom&mdash;for
      its size&mdash;equal to that in the little wood. Sally, who did not
      attempt to conceal her dislike of her brother-in-law, whispered: &ldquo;That's
      the way to bring them down,&rdquo; and Frank was obliged to laugh. Then she and
      Maggie disappeared as if the earth had swallowed them for several hours.
      The Grenadier Guards played on the lawn, and Frank was introduced to
      ladies of all ages and sizes; and as these bored him, he began to see that
      the place was vulgar and the people shoddy, and he wondered what Mount
      Rorke would say if he were to come suddenly across him. Grace was the
      subject of much concern, and obviously <i>enceinte,</i> she passed through
      the different groups. She had introduced Frank as Lord Mount Rorke's son,
      then as his nephew, then as his heir, and, fearing she might succumb to
      the temptation of introducing him as Mount Rorke himself, Frank escaped
      from her, and joined a party that Berkins was personally conducting
      through the grounds.
    </p>

      The stables had been built by So-and-so on the most approved principles.
      There were no stables like them in Sussex&mdash;the fittings of the
      harness-room alone had cost him three hundred. The horses he had bought at
      the Duke's sale, the Duke would not have thought of parting with them had
      he known how they would turn out. He had driven them along the Brighton
      road at the rate of fifteen miles an hour; he would back them to do
      fifteen miles in the hour. There was not a pair of horses in England equal
      to them. That was Mrs. Berkins's riding horse&mdash;was it possible to
      imagine a more perfect cob? He could get a hundred for him any day, he did
      not know of anything like him. &ldquo;Did any of you gentleman ever see anything
      like him?&rdquo; They went to the kennels. A brace of Irish setters were
      declared to be the finest dogs that Ireland had ever produced, they had
      taken two prizes, one in Dublin and another in Brighton&mdash;and the
      little fox terrier was the gamest dog in Sussex. She would go into any
      hole after a fox, and never leave him till she brought him out. You
      couldn't find her equal. Then the glass-houses were perfect. They
      contained all the latest improvements, and all these were fully explained.
      &ldquo;Berkins is excelling himself to-day,&rdquo; thought Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently they came upon a basket of peaches.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These peaches were, of course, grown under glass, but I think I am right
      in saying, Jackson, that they were produced without artificial heat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, quite right, sir. It couldn't be done nowhere else, sir, but
      all the sun in Sussex seems to come down here&mdash;a regular little sun
      trap, I think that's what you called it the other day, sir, when you were
      speaking to me about them there peaches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I did. If you move nearer the sea you get fogs and cold winds,
      further inland you lose the sun, but just here the climate is equal to the
      south of Europe! I ask you to look at these peaches, it seems impossible&mdash;does
      it not?&mdash;to have peaches like these at the end of May, and without
      any heat, merely glass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me quite impossible,&rdquo; declared a little fat man with flaxen
      hair. &ldquo;I am devoted to peach-growing, and I confess I am quite at a loss.
      Gardener, did you say that those peaches were grown entirely without
      artificial heat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gardener pretended not to hear, and tried to slip away, but the little
      man, who had been taken on his hobby, was not to be baulked, and he
      pursued the wretched horticulturist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean to say that these peaches ripened without any artificial heat,
      any?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no idea what a sun we get here, sir. I have never seen anything
      like it. In my last situation, when I was living with Lord &mdash;&mdash;,
      we couldn't get our fruit forward, use whatever heat he might, and
      Houghton is not more than fifty miles from here&mdash;the difference of
      climate is positively wonderful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jackson had reckoned that Mr. Berkins would move on, and that the
      inquisitive little man would find himself obliged to follow, but chance
      was against him, for Berkins, with his guests around him, stood listening
      to the discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean to say that these peaches were grown without heat. I wouldn't
      mind giving you five-and-twenty pounds for the recipe for doing it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must take a small place down here, sir, and then you will be able to
      do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This raised a laugh, but the little man was not to be beaten, and he said:
      &ldquo;I should like to see some of those peaches of yours on the trees. You
      haven't plucked them all; let me see them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Jackson, show us the trees. Some will not believe without seeing;
      let us see the peaches on the trees.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jackson appeared to be a little disconcerted; he murmured excuses, and
      strove to escape. Driven to bay he brought them into a glass-house where
      there were hot water-pipes, and when his tormentor pointed triumphantly to
      the pipes he attempted a faint explanation&mdash;he had meant to say that
      heat had only been used within the last three weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you see, Berkins,&rdquo; exclaimed little flaxen-haired fatty, &ldquo;your south
      of Europe is no better than my south of Europe, or anybody else's south of
      Europe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jackson, you have told me many deliberate falsehoods about these peaches.
      I keep no one in my employment whose word cannot be depended upon. You
      take your warning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Falsehoods! What do you want a man to do, if you will have everything
      better than anybody else's?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Berkins turned suddenly on his heel, he drew himself up to his full
      height, and stood speechless with indignation. Never, not even on the most
      important Board meetings, did his friends wait to hear him speak with more
      anxiety; but at that moment a crash of flower pots was heard, and Sally
      and a young man were discovered hiding in the potting shed; and to make
      matters worse, in the very next house they visited, they suddenly came
      upon Maggie sitting with another young man in strangely compromising
      circumstances. Explanations were attempted, and some stupid remarks were
      made. Berkins was seriously annoyed, and he took the first opportunity of
      taking Mr. Brookes's arm and leading him away to a quiet path. Frank saw
      the men pass through the laurels, and ten minutes after he saw them
      return. Evidently Berkins had read Mr. Brookes an exhaustive lecture on
      the conduct of his daughters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Mr. Brookes, now Mr. Brookes, I must beg of you&mdash;calm yourself.
      What would my guests think if they found you in tears? What would they
      think I had been saying to reduce you to such a condition? It is
      veryunfortunate that Sally and Maggie should act as they do, particularly
      at my place; but really you must not give way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since the death of their poor mother I am all alone. My position is a
      very trying one.&rdquo; Then, with a sudden burst of laughter, &ldquo;However, I
      suppose it will be all the same a hundred years hence!&rdquo;

      The girls walked to the station with Escott. A fleecy evening, with the
      clouds growing pale towards the sea, the sun like fire in the elms, and
      the woods showing upon a purple tinge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How delightful!&rdquo; exclaimed Frank. &ldquo;How charming this is&mdash;this old
      English green, the horse pond at one end, the various houses, the inn, the
      grocery business, the linen drying in that yard, the smith, and the
      wheelwright. I don't like that modern Queen Anne school-house, and I wish
      I could remove the dead level of the embankment and see the sea. The green
      is better from this side with the view of the Downs&mdash;those lines
      waving against the sky, where the gorse grows and the sheep feed, and
      inclining to the road all the fields pale green and deep green. But what
      game are those men playing&mdash;what game do you call that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bat and trap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have passed the green twenty times before, and I never really saw it
      till now. It is charming&mdash;so thoroughly English. I should like to
      live here for a month&mdash;for two months. How nice it would be to
      breakfast in the morning looking out on the green, to see the cocks and
      hens and all the children and all this English life! How different from
      Pump Court! I am sick of Pump Court&mdash;dirt and smoke, a horrid
      servant, stale eggs. I suppose you can always get fresh eggs and new bread
      here? I would give anything to spend a month on the green.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you can!&rdquo; cried Sally. &ldquo;I wish you would, and you could come and
      play tennis with us every afternoon. Mrs. Heald has some rooms to let; why
      it was only last week I heard that she hadn't let her rooms this season,
      and was most anxious to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's no use my coming here until I begin to write my novel. I am
      painting now, and I must see if I can get my picture finished for one of
      the autumn exhibitions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew you would find some excuse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I assure you, but I can't do anything without a studio, and I'm not
      likely to find a studio on Southwick Green.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't suppose Mrs. Heald has a room large enough for a studio,&rdquo; said
      Maggie; &ldquo;but I don't see why you shouldn't find a place where you can
      paint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where? Not in that eighteenth-century house where the two old ladies are
      standing! Supposing I were to go and ask them if they would let me have
      their drawing-room to paint in! That is the only house on the green, all
      the rest are cottages.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you are not very particular where you paint,&rdquo; said Maggie
      reflectively. &ldquo;You don't mind appearances, I suppose? I wonder if you
      could manage to fit up a farm building.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is the famous barn where Charles the First hid himself, I don't
      suppose the authorities would allow me to turn that into a studio.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, probably not; but I think you might find a house that would do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What nonsense, Maggie,&rdquo; said Sally, who began to grow jealous of her
      sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why is it nonsense? I see no reason why Frank shouldn't come to some
      arrangement with the smith, and turn his house into a studio.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which is the smith's house? I'll tell you in a moment if it could be
      turned into a studio.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That house standing quite by itself in the corner of the green.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That tall narrow house with the bit of broken wall and the elder bushes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I daresay I could rig up a very nice studio out of that place, indeed it
      looks quite picturesque amid its elder bushes. There is the stile, and
      there is the cornfield. But I couldn't live there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you would live at Mrs. Heald's, and you could walk over every morning
      to the studio.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I could do that. I prefer to live with my work. There is nothing
      like walking from the breakfast table across the room to the easel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you can find fault with everything; nothing is perfect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There goes the train!&rdquo; cried Sally. &ldquo;No use in running now, you've missed
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How very provoking; the next isn't till half-past seven&mdash;just an
      hour to wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Maggie, &ldquo;if you have missed the train we may as well go at
      once and ask Mrs. Heald if she has let her rooms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They walked towards a block of cottages&mdash;at one end the &ldquo;Cricketer's
      Arms,&rdquo; at the other the grocery business; and the cottage that joined the
      grocery business was remarkable for a bit of green paling and wooden
      balcony, now covered with Virginia creeper. Frank thought at once of
      new-laid eggs, and the sunlight glancing through a great mass of greenery,
      and he resolved if a sacrifice were necessary to live at Southwick, he
      would put his picture aside and begin his novel. The people in the house
      pleased him, and he ran on in his way thinking how English and trustworthy
      they seemed, liking the green parrot that rubbed its head affectionately
      against the grey ringlets of a very ladylike old person; and Mrs. Heald,
      brisk as a bee, notwithstanding her lame leg, who led the way up the
      ladder-like cottage staircase.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How nice and clean everything is; books and engravings along the
      passages. How unlike Ireland!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the sitting-room was full of horsehair sofas and chairs. These
      displeased Frank, but some handsome china&mdash;an entire tea service in
      Crown Derby&mdash;reconciled him to the room. In the bedroom they found a
      huge four-poster of old time, with a lengthy bolster and imposing pillows,
      and they were shown into another and a similar room. One looked out on the
      green, the other on the fields that lay between the green and the Manor
      House.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that elm were cut down you could see my window,&rdquo; said Sally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which room do you like the best?&rdquo; said Maggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is hard to say. The other room looks on the green, but here there is a
      nice large wardrobe, and I don't see how I can get on without a wardrobe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you like the other room best, sir, I can turn out the chest of
      drawers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that would be very nice if you can manage it, the room will do very
      well. I can have a bath every morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; there will be no difficulty about that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maggie had taken off her hat and was settling her hair before the glass.
      Sally opened the wardrobe, revealing various petticoats and skirts, but
      she thought of it as full of Frank's light overcoats, the scarves he wore
      round his throat when he went out in evening clothes, the patent leather
      shoes in the corner. Suddenly the conversation dropped, and after a pause
      Frank said: &ldquo;I think these rooms suit me very well, but I can do nothing;
      it is impossible for me to say if I can take them until I find out if
      there is any place in the immediate neighbourhood that I could convert
      into a studio. Do you know of any such place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I do not, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Escott was thinking of seeing the smith about his house. I wonder if
      Town would let it to Mr. Escott for a consideration,&rdquo; said Maggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, I should have to get leave to make what alterations I
      pleased.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't suppose the house belongs to Town, sir; I don't think he is more
      than a weekly tenant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that's the case, we must see the landlord. Do you know who is the
      landlord?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't say I do, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mrs. Heald, I will let you know in a day or two if I can take your
      rooms&mdash;you can give me a day or two?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, but I should like to know as soon as possible; several people
      have been asking after my rooms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll let you know in a day or two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Town is only a weekly tenant, you'll be able to get his house by
      paying a little more for it,&rdquo; said Maggie, as they walked down the green
      towards the smith's forge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would be hardly fair; I should like to act squarely by the smith.
      What is his name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Town was cutting out the hoof of a shaggy grey cart horse when his
      visitors entered the cindery blackness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Town, this gentleman would like to speak to you,&rdquo; said Maggie, raising
      her voice above the wheezy bellows. He threw the hoof out of his apron,
      and, drawing his blackened arm across his forehead, he came forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Town, I am anxious to find a place on the green that I could convert into
      a studio; I think your house would suit my purpose very well. Do you think
      we could come to some arrangement? Of course I would give you a reasonable
      compensation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I really hardly know, sir; I dunno that I hardly understand. You
      want my house to turn into a&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A studio&mdash;a place where I can paint pictures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see how I can do without my 'ouse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I will compensate you&mdash;make it worth your while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see it is so near my work. Was I to go and live at Ada Terrace, I
      should, you see, be out of the way. If people want a job done they always
      knows where to find me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but if I compensate you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seeing that Frank was exciting the smith with too wild hopes of wealth,
      Sally thought fit to interpose. &ldquo;Mr. Escott would require permission to
      make any alterations in the building he thought proper&mdash;you couldn't
      give him permission; he would in any case have to see your landlord. Who
      is your landlord?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see how I can give up my 'ouse to be turned into a painting
      place; it wouldn't suit me at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I make you sufficient compensation&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again the smith was reduced to silence. He scratched his head, and Frank
      watched the sparks fly, and heard the rhythmical sledge. &ldquo;I wish he
      wouldn't talk so much about compensation,&rdquo; thought Sally. &ldquo;I don't know
      what the man won't be asking if Frank doesn't shut up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think we shall be able to come to an understanding? I want to
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you see, sir, my wife is delicate, and I'm that afraid she wouldn't
      like to give up her 'ome. But I'll speak to 'er if you like to-night,
      sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Escott will have to see your landlord; he will have to arrange with
      him about the alterations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There will be no difficulty about the alterations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very probably; but you are only a weekly tenant. It is a question your
      landlord must decide. If he agrees to allow Mr. Escott to make the
      alterations, Mr. Escott will no doubt compensate you for disturbance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all very well to talk about compensation. How do I know what your
      compensation will be? How do I know you will make it worth my while? I
      don't want no compensation. I want my 'ouse. Cheek I calls it, to come
      down here wanting to muck me out of my house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, sir, we want no impertinence. I shall do exactly as I please in the
      matter. Your landlord is the person I should have spoken to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spoken to! Who are you, I should like to know, coming round here
      interfering in my business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All Frank's discussions ended in angry words, and he never came to terms
      with any one without threatening blows. Town returned to the forge; Frank
      and the young ladies made their way across the green. At the corner of
      Southdown Road they found the General, the schoolmaster, and a retired
      farmer ardently gossiping; Mrs. Horlock, prim in her black gown and poke
      bonnet, waited with admirable patience, and Angel, the blind pug, in
      horrible corpulence, waddled and sniffed the grass. The story of Town's
      impertinence was told. The General was shocked&mdash;it was surprising.
      What are we coming to? The retired farmer said that Town was a
      hot-tempered man, but not a bad sort when you knew how to take him, and
      all, except Mrs. Horlock, agreed that the landlord was the person who
      should be consulted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really don't see why you should turn the poor man out of his house if
      he doesn't want to go. How would you like some one to come and turn you
      out of your house?&rdquo; she said, turning to her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General laughed. &ldquo;My dear Lucy, whatever you say must be right. So you
      are coming to live at Southwick. Very glad to hear it. You know where to
      find us, the gate's always open; lunch at half-past one, dinner at eight&mdash;old
      Indians, you know; come in when you like. Pretty place I have here,
      everything I want&mdash;stables and horses, and (the General looked to see
      if Lucy was out of hearing) plenty of dogs, you know&mdash;a few too many;
      but my wife, you know&mdash;&rdquo; The rest was lost in a burst of good-natured
      laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      They bade the Horlocks good-night and walked up the Southdown Road,
      looking with its line of trees along the pavement like a little mock
      boulevard. Frank was particularly severe in his remarks on the trim privet
      hedges and the little bronze sphinxes standing before the portico of
      yellow glass; he declared that a man must be born to put up such things,
      and he clearly thought this sneer a very happy one, for he repeated it,
      fearing that Sally had not understood. The grocer who had placed a
      bas-relief of himself over his door was greatly wondered at, and Sally
      told an amusing anecdote regarding the invitations he sent out for the
      first dinner party. The conversation turned on the Measons. Jack's ship
      had gone to China, and he was not expected back much before Christmas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's very sad, Sally. How will you be able to live through so many
      months?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care for him. I don't care if I never saw him again&mdash;it was
      Fanny who was my friend. Some nice people have come to live in that corner
      house&mdash;a young man, who is learning farming. Mr. Berkins insists on
      father not allowing us to visit any one in the Southdown Road, and Mr.
      Berkins can turn father round his finger, he is so much richer. I'm not
      allowed to see Fanny at the Manor House. As for Jack, I daresay you won't
      believe me, but I shouldn't care if I never saw him again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maggie shrugged her shoulders. The gesture exasperated Sally, and she
      turned on her sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn't shrug your shoulders at me, miss; I never flirted with him;
      you did, and then you set father against me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, for goodness' sake don't quarrel; what does it matter? The idea of
      Berkins telling your father whom he should visit; and the idea of your
      father permitting it merely because he makes two or three thousand a year
      more! He surely doesn't object to your visiting Mrs. Horlock?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he couldn't do that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still engaged in discussion, they entered the gates of the Manor House,
      and Mr. Brookes was told that Frank would stay at Southwick a few days
      longer, so that he might arrange about a studio. The news was not at first
      wholly pleasing to the old gentleman, but he remembered the anecdotes he
      should hear concerning his favourite painters, and was consoled. The
      evening passed away in the security and calm of habit, sweetened by the
      intimacy of familiar thoughts and customs. There was the usual expensive
      dinner; Mr. Brookes lit a cigar, handed the box to Frank, and said,
      puffing lustily, &ldquo;That's a good picture, paid a lot of money for it, too
      much money, mustn't do it again. You were a pupil of Bouguereau; great
      painter; you have seen him paint; you would know his touch amid a
      thousand, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      About ten o'clock steps in the passage, then the squeak-squeak of the
      cork; then the goggle-guggle of the water, and the young ladies came in
      with their grog. They kissed their father and brother, shook hands with
      Frank, and went to bed. Further anecdotes concerning the painters were
      told; further condemnations of the Southdown Road were pronounced; the
      house was locked up; Mr. Brookes retired, and the young men continued the
      conversation in their rooms. Willy told Frank all about his shop, Frank
      told Willy all about his studio, and they went to sleep delighted with
      each other and at peace with the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Brookes had gone when the young men came down next morning. Willy was
      down first, and when Frank finished breakfast he found him busy in the
      garden making purchases for his shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much am I to charge for these peaches, sir?&rdquo; said the gardener.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I intend to pay the market price for everything. I don't know what
      peaches are selling at in Covent Garden. I will look it up and let you
      know. I am taking two dozen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, there are only very few more ripe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a pity I can't have them all,&rdquo; Willy whispered to Frank. &ldquo;There is
      a tremendous profit to be made on peaches. Now, I want some new potatoes.
      How many can you let me have?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, sir, we are very short; you see it is so early in the year. We
      have only a few, none too many for the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must have some, if it is only a sample. How much are potatoes selling
      at now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, I hardly know. Last year we bought some off Hooper at&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These are the things I have to contend with. How am I to keep my books
      right if I don't know exactly the price things are selling for? I may be
      paying more for his potatoes than they are selling in Brighton for. My
      father gets more out of the shop than any one, and he isn't satisfied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woes of this suburban Lear amused Frank. No sooner was the arch enemy
      Meason on the high seas, and the Southdown Road had quieted down, than
      another demon had risen up against him; his garden was ravished of its
      fairest fruits and vegetables, his carriages were turned into market
      carts, and all, as he said, for the sake of practising an elaborate system
      of book-keeping. Maggie, who had finished her house-keeping, came into the
      garden, and she went with Frank down the town in search of the landlord of
      the tall house amid the elder bushes. For a small increase in the rent,
      and a promise to undo all alterations before leaving, putting the house
      back in the same arrangement of rooms as it at present stood, the landlord
      agreed to allow Frank to do his will with the place. For twenty pounds the
      smith was silenced, and Frank explained to the local builder that the
      house was to be thrown into one room, and the ceilings of the upper rooms
      were to be removed. He had thought of having the rafters painted, but at
      the builder's suggestion he decided to have them lined with fresh timber
      and stained. This would look very handsome. A large window, some six feet
      by eight, would have to be put in the north wall. Of course, all the
      doors, windows, etc., would have to be taken away and replaced by new. He
      would have a book-case in stained wood. An estimate was drawn up. It came
      to a good deal more than he had intended to lay out, and Frank dreaded the
      expense. But he must live somewhere, he was sick of Pump Court, and his
      friends and this little south-coast village were now ardent in his mind;
      why not live here? True that the country was in no way beautiful and
      offered no temptations to a landscape painter, but he seldom painted
      landscapes, and if he wanted a bit of woodland he would find it over the
      Downs. Then there was the sea, and that was always interesting. Perhaps
      Mount Rorke would let him have the money. The old fellow had never refused
      him an extra hundred when he asked for it. Yes, he would risk it. So the
      order was given, and all the delays and broken promises of a builder began
      to be experienced and endured. Frank, who now lodged at Mrs. Heald's, hung
      around the workmen, counting each brick, and commenting on every piece of
      woodwork. He at once took to grumbling at their slowness, and he soon
      declared that all hopes of his being able to finish his picture for the
      Academy were at an end, and he paraded his misfortunes at the Manor House,
      at Mrs. Horlock's, and, indeed, at all the houses he went to for tea or
      tennis parties. The painters especially annoyed him, and he even went so
      far as to threaten them with an action.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long before they had finished his pictures had arrived from London, and
      several pieces of furniture from Brighton. The ideas of this young man
      were now in full revolt against oriental draperies and things from Japan.
      The furniture was, therefore, to consist of large cane sofas with pillows
      covered with a yellow chintz pattern which pleased him much. The selection
      of a carpet was a matter of great moment. He received with scornful smiles
      his upholsterer's suggestions of Persian rugs. Turkey, Smyrna, and
      Axminster were proposed and rejected, he even thought of an Aubusson&mdash;no
      one knew anything about Aubusson at Southwick, and the vivid blues and
      yellows and symmetrical design would have at least the merit of disturbing
      if not of wrecking the artistic opinions of his friends. He discovered one
      of these carpets in a back street in Brighton, and with some cleaning and
      mending he felt sure it could be made to look quite well. But no, if you
      have an Aubusson carpet you must have Louis XIV. furniture in the room,
      and Louis XIV. in Southwick would be too absurd. Clearly the Aubusson
      scheme must be abandoned&mdash;he would have a rich grey carpet, soft and
      woolly, and there should be a round table covered with a dark blue cloth,
      set off with a yellow margin, and the chairs drawn about the table should
      be covered with dark blue and painted yellow. A grand piano was
      indispensable in Frank's surroundings, both for its appearance in the
      studio and the relaxation it afforded in the various interludes. Several
      journeys to London were made before the lamps to be used were determined
      on (a modern design was essential), and the brass fittings to hang candles
      from the rafters required still more delicate and cautious consideration;
      at last it was decided to have none.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this while Willy was busy with his shop. He had taken a whole house,
      and at first he had thought of letting a room, but for many reasons this
      scheme had to be abandoned. He did not know who might take the room. &ldquo;Who
      knows&mdash;perhaps one of my own friends, a member of my club, for
      instance?&rdquo; Then it would give the missus a lot of bother and worry, and
      she had all she could do in looking after the shop. To make a thing a
      success you must think of nothing else. It was a pity, but it wasn't to be
      thought of. Otherwise he seemed fairly well satisfied. There was a back
      door leading on to a back lane, in turn leading on to a back street, so
      with his latch-key he could pop in and out unobserved. All his books and
      papers in the drawing-room, the ledger, the day-book, the cash-book all
      ready, all to hand, so that after dinner, when he had smoked his pipe, he
      could go to work. Frank alone was in the secret. And how the young men
      enjoyed going to Brighton together. Frank worried Willy, who ran up and
      down stairs collecting his brown paper parcels, calling upon him to make
      haste. They set forth, Willy firm and methodical, his shoulders set well
      back: Frank loose and swaggering, over-dressed. How to get to the shop was
      a matter of anxious consideration. Willy was fearful of detection, and all
      sorts of stratagems were resorted to. Sometimes they would walk down to
      the Old Steyne, and suddenly double and get back through a medley of
      obscure streets, or else they would publicly walk up and down the King's
      Road, and when they thought no one was looking, hurry up one of the
      by-streets, and so gain their haven, the lane. Once they were in the lane
      they slackened speed, all danger was then over, and they laughed
      consumedly at their escapes, and delighted in telling each other how
      So-and-so and his daughter had been successfully avoided. Willy always had
      his latch-key ready; in a moment they were inside, and Frank would rush
      upstairs and throw himself into the armchair, crying: &ldquo;Here we are!&rdquo; One
      day they were at the window, when, to their amazement, the Manor House
      carriage pulled up before the shop, and they had only just time to dodge
      behind the curtain and escape Sally's eyes. Never before had the carriage
      arrived later than five o'clock, and now it was nearly six. What could be
      the meaning of this? Begging of Frank not to move, Willy went out on the
      landing and listened to his sisters talking to his wife. The girls&mdash;who
      were, of course, ignorant of their relationship to the shop-woman&mdash;liked
      Mrs. Brookes very much, and were fond of a chat with her; and, looking
      through the blinds, Frank saw the footman in all the splendour of six feet
      and grey livery carrying a small pot of flowers worth sixpence from the
      carriage to the shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      On ordinary days the shop was shut at eight, but when Willy and Frank
      dined there it was closed an hour earlier. Frank enjoyed his evenings
      there; he enjoyed it all&mdash;the homeliness and the quiet. He enjoyed
      seeing Willy nurse the missus after dinner, and he found no difficulty in
      pretending a certain interest in the book-keeping, and an admiration for
      the lines of figures all carefully formed, and the beautifully ruled
      lines. Cissy adored him. He took her on his knee, and she leaned her
      hollow cheek against his handsome face. She would have probably rushed to
      death to serve him. His height, his brightness, his rings, his spotted
      neckties&mdash;all seemed so perfect, so beautiful, to her; and when he
      brought his fiddle she would sit and look at him, her little hands clasped
      with an intensity of love that was strange and pitiful. Swaying from side
      to side, he ran on from tune to tune&mdash;waltzes, reminiscences from
      operas, fragments of overtures, delightful snatches from Schubert; and
      when he introduced Willy to one tune&mdash;a tune in which all his <i>might-have-been</i>
      was bound&mdash;the dry man seemed to grow drier: perhaps it brought a
      glow of pleasure to his heart: but be this as it may, he only sat and
      puffed more emphatically at his pipe.

      XI
    </h2>
    <p>
      For Frank this pleasant English village was now a happy <i>fete</i> of
      summer joys and occupations. Oh! the hill prospects and the shady gardens
      around the coasts. And when he went inland he would return by choice
      across the Downs, and in the patriarchal valleys where nothing is heard
      but the bell-wether he would stand in the great, lonely darkness, and see
      the lights of Brighton brighten the sky above the ridges, and climbing up
      the ridges, he gazed on the vague sea, and the long string of coast towns
      were like a golden necklace.
    </p>
    <p>
      His days went like dreams. The morning hours&mdash;bachelor hours&mdash;were
      full of intimacy and joy. The joy of waking alone with a strange and
      secret self that, like a shy bird, is all the day chased out of sight and
      hearing, but is with you when you awake in sweet health in the morning;
      that of waking alone with the sunlight in the curtains, that of being
      alone with your body as well as your mind, and no presence to jar the
      communion. There is a dear privacy in morning hours of single life.
    </p>
    <p>
      But although the desire to exchange these for the joys of wedlock was
      germinating in Frank, although it was inherent in him to understand the
      husband's happiness when he puts his arm round a dear wife's neck and
      draws her to him with marital kisses and affectionate words, he was
      certainly conscious that each hour seemed to bring its special pleasure.
      His room was airy and pleasant, the window full of the colour of the green
      and its aspects; the little water-course with its brick bridge, the trees
      along the embankment, the rigging of the ships in the harbour, the linen
      drying in the yard. Of these views Frank seemed never to grow tired; he
      noted them as he brushed his brown curls over his forehead, and when he
      sat at breakfast eating fresh eggs and marmalade. After breakfast he lay
      on the sofa, and read society papers and smoked cigarettes. He could not
      drag himself to the studio. &ldquo;A man should live at his studio, impossible
      to settle down to work, if he doesn't,&rdquo; he thought, and he watched Mrs.
      Horlock coming up the green accompanied by the chemist's wife and the
      pugs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear old lady, how nice she looks in her black dress and poke bonnet! And
      there goes the General&mdash;he is giving all his coppers to the
      children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frank took up a volume of Browning, turned over the leaves, and laid the
      book down to watch a drove of horses that had suddenly been turned out on
      the green to feed, and he laughed to see the children throwing stones,
      making them gallop frantically. Very often the thunder of the hoofs
      alarmed Triss, and he stood on his hind legs and barked. &ldquo;What is it, old
      dog? What is it? Like to have a go at the horses? Shall we go out and play
      with the pugs?&rdquo; At the mention of going out Triss cocked his ears and
      barked. &ldquo;I suppose I must make a move. I wonder what the time is&mdash;half-past
      eleven. Good Heavens! The post will be here at twelve. I had better wait
      for it.&rdquo; On waking his first thoughts were for his letters, and almost
      before he had finished reading them he had begun to think of what the
      mid-day delivery would bring him. To see the boy pass and so have ocular
      proof that there was nothing for him seemed to lighten his disappointment.
      He saw him waste his time with the doctor's horse and then with the
      maid-servant, and if the old ladies were not about he would stand talking
      many minutes with their servants. Then he visited the short line of
      cottages, passed sometimes round the yard or open space at the back of the
      wheelwright's, where the linen hung on poles between the elms, and once
      Frank saw the provoking boy hide behind the cricketers' tent and remain
      watching the match. For half an hour the question&mdash;letters or no
      letters&mdash;hung in suspense, and when the loiterer came, stopping every
      minute to see where the ball was hit to, the joy, heightened by
      anticipation, was great in receiving a packet of newspapers and various
      correspondence. Frank often went to meet him. True, he might have nothing
      for him, he might be going to deliver at the grocer's shop, or at the
      &ldquo;Cricketer's Arms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any letters for me, to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, two postcards and a newspaper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was disappointing not to get a letter&mdash;postcards meant nothing. He
      only exchanged a few words with Mrs. Horlock, and passed on to the
      General, who, at the corner of the Southdown Road where the gossipers met,
      was discussing a local candidature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you are off to paint. You must come and see the model my wife has done
      of a horse I once had. I mustn't say much about him, though&mdash;it is a
      sore subject. After winning over a thousand with him I lost it all, and
      five hundred with it. She never would paint his picture for me; but
      yesterday was my birthday&mdash;I suppose she thought she would give me a
      treat, she began to model him from memory&mdash;wonderful likeness&mdash;she
      knows every bone and sinew in a horse&mdash;clever woman, never seen any
      one like her. Come in to-night, dinner always at eight&mdash;old Indians.
      She'll show it to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, not to-night, General; to-morrow night, if you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, to-morrow night at eight. What a terrible dog that is of
      yours! You need fear nobody while you have him with you. You must ask my
      wife to paint him for you, but I forgot, I beg your pardon&mdash;you are a
      painter; you should paint him yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't paint animals. I shall be very glad if Mrs. Horlock will paint
      him; there is some beautiful drawing about him&mdash;those fore-legs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Probably attracted by the dog, Mrs. Horlock came walking towards them.
      Triss went sidling after Rose, and when Mrs. Horlock called him, he
      growled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg of you, Mrs. Horlock, do not touch him; he isn't safe, I assure
      you. He once bit a man's nose off who was trying to train him to do
      something or other. I will not be answerable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All nonsense! No dog ever bit me, they know I love them. 'Come to me,
      sir.' No dog ever bit me but once, and he was a poor mongrel that had been
      hunted by a lot of horrid men. I was dressing to go to a ball at the
      Government House, and I heard him under my bed. He had taken refuge under
      my bed, poor thing. He was frightened to death; he couldn't see me, and he
      bit me through the wrist. I went to the ball all the same. A dog died of
      hydrophobia in my arms. He died like a child, licking my hands and face.
      'Come here, sir. Come to me.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you wouldn't do it, Mrs. Horlock. I am afraid to call him, for
      fear he should think I intended to set him at you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Triss showed a terrible set of teeth, and his nose seemed to curl back
      almost into his eyes; but stooping down Mrs. Horlock extended her hands to
      him. She looked so like herself in the poke bonnet and the black dress,
      and the kind, intelligent eyes softened the dog's humour, and he came to
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see&mdash;what did I tell you? Dogs know so well those that love
      them. No animal ever did bite me except that poor frightened creature, and
      he didn't mean it. We kept him for ten years after that, and how he did
      love me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wonderful woman, my wife; she can do what she likes with animals. I was
      telling Mr. Escott that he must come in and see the model you are making
      of Snap-dragon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only an amateur, I never had a lesson in my life. Mr. Escott would think
      nothing of it, I am sure. But I wish he'd come in and dine with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He promised to come to-morrow, Lucy; but stay, isn't that the day we are
      going to have the Bath people in to dine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind&mdash;Mr. Escott won't mind, I'm sure. They are very nice,
      good people, indeed. I'm sure you'll think so. They are all snobs about
      this place. I never heard of such snobbery in my life. Mrs. So-and-so&mdash;over
      there&mdash;once said to me, 'I believe you know all the people who live
      in those little houses.' She said she wouldn't allow her children even to
      walk across the green. Did you ever hear of such snobbery?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mrs. Horlock, as I have always said, your position is made; you
      have your friends who will like you and value you just the same no matter
      whom you may walk about the green with. Every Viceroy that ever went to
      India called on you; your position is made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are a lot of snobs about here; but I mustn't keep Angel waiting, he
      is never well unless he gets a little exercise. We shall see you then at
      eight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The cleverest woman I ever knew. I don't say the cleverest that you ever
      knew. But we have got too many animals; I often wish I could get rid of
      the brutes,&rdquo; and the General laughed as he stumped along. &ldquo;Five horses
      when two would be sufficient&mdash;five horses eating their heads off;
      then the Circassian goats that the neighbours complain of, and the parrots
      and the squirrels. There are a few too many, there's no doubt. But once an
      animal comes into the place she will cherish it for ever. I try to keep
      Prince out of the drawing-room as much as possible, she says she can't
      smell him. If that little beast Angel would only die!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't you poison him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would if I dared; but just think, if my wife heard of it she would go
      out of her mind. I don't think she'd have me in the house.&rdquo; The General
      laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We all have our troubles, General. Good-bye, I'm off to work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucky man to have something to do. If I had a little something&mdash;just
      a little something to bring me out, I should be perfectly happy. Then at
      eight. Good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Half-past twelve! Half the day gone, I really must make an effort to get
      to the studio earlier. It is, as I said, useless to hope to get through
      work unless you wake up where your work is. A man doesn't get a chance. I
      wonder if I could build a bedroom out at the back? I have let Mount Rorke
      in for three hundred extra this year; he would turn rusty if I spent any
      more. I must give him a rest; besides, I don't want to have the workmen in
      again. I wish I could get ivy to grow over those walls, they do look
      precious shabby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at the tall dilapidated walls showing above the dark green of
      the elder bushes, and lingered, for it was a soft blue summer's day with
      just a breeze stirring, and the corn waved yellow, and the dim expanses of
      the Downs extended in faint lines and dim tints.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he entered his studio his colour scheme pleased him, and looking at
      the rafters he thought that the stained wood was handsome and appropriate.
      The grey carpet was soft under foot, and the lustre and form of a grand
      piano suggested Chopin and Schubert. His studio seemed to him a symbol of
      his own refinement, and being moved, perhaps, by the silence and the quiet
      of the north light, he took his violin, and turning from time to time to
      look on himself on the glass or his picture on the easel, he played
      Stradella's &ldquo;Chanson d'Eglise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then seeing, or rather thinking he saw, how he could improve his
      landscape, he took up his palette, and in a desultory and uncertain
      fashion he painted till five o'clock. &ldquo;It is no use,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;I can
      do nothing with it until I get a model, but the devil of it is, there are
      no models in Brighton&mdash;at least, I don't know where to go and look
      for one, and it is no use asking Sally or Maggie to sit. They'll sit for
      five minutes, and then say they have some work to do at home, and must be
      off. You must have a professional model, a girl you pay a shilling an hour&mdash;I
      might sling the hammock from there to here&mdash;I wonder where I could
      get a girl who would do. I can't have a girl off the street; she must be
      more or less respectable&mdash;I wonder whom I can get. That girl in the
      bar-room at the station would do.&rdquo; Putting his palette away with a lazy
      gesture, he thought for a few minutes of Lizzie Baker. What had become of
      her? And why had she disappeared?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nearly a year and a half ago now. What a jolly day up the river!
      All the beauty of the flowing water, the crowning woods and whispering
      rushes filled his mind, and yielding to the moment's emotion he took some
      verses out of an escritoire and altered several lines. Another abandoning
      the search for a suitable rhyme he turned to a portrait of Maggie which he
      had begun a few days before. She stood in a pose that was habitual to her&mdash;her
      hands linked behind her, the head leaned on one side, the little black
      eyes&mdash;but not ugly eyes&mdash;fixed in a sweet subtle and enquiring
      look. The thinness, and, indeed, the angularity of her figure was almost
      powerfully indicated with broad lines of paint and charcoal. It was
      Frank's most successful effort. He knew this, and he said to himself, &ldquo;Not
      half bad, very like her, quite the character; the drawing is right, if I
      could only go on with it; if I could only model the face. I see very well
      where I shall get into trouble&mdash;that shadow about the neck, the
      jawbone, the cheekbone, and then all that rich colour about the eyes.&rdquo;
       Then he thought he would walk over to the Manor House, and he must hasten,
      for it was half-past five, and tea was always ready in the verandah.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stayed for dinner; he talked to Mr. Brookes about painters in the
      billiard-room; he strayed through the shadows and the perfumes of leaves
      and flowers through the gentle moonlight with his arms about the girls.
      And as they walked it seemed to Frank that his life was so mingled with
      theirs that he could not think of one sister apart from the other. The
      dusk gathered; the sky became a decoration in blue and gold; the scent of
      the sea came over the embankment, filling the garden. Day followed day,
      without anything happening to stay or check the gentle tide of their
      mutual affections; neither was jealous of her sister, for their desires
      were set upon others. Frank was but an ideal, a repose, a pious aspiration
      which joined their hands and hearts leaving them free of any stress of
      passion, Maggie claiming him a little more than Sally, and Sally yielding
      her claim to her without knowing that she was yielding it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is only natures that are never gross&mdash;calm and tepid livers&mdash;that
      are really incapable of ideality, of real and adequate aspiration; nature
      works by flux and reflux; and if we waive the rough temper and the coarse
      edge of passion due to youth, it will not be impossible to conceive
      another picture of these girls. Sally, good-hearted and true, full of
      sturdy, homely sense, willing to take care of a man's money, and make him
      a straightforward wife; Maggie, gentle and sinuating&mdash;always a little
      false, but always attractive, the enchantment of a man's home. Frank,
      notwithstanding his genuine admiration of all that was young and sweet and
      pure, was of poor and separating fibre, and it is clear that it will take
      all the strength of society to support him and save him from sinking of
      his own weight.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, as he was coming through the station from the post-office, he met
      Maggie with a young man. He was introduced, and they returned to the Manor
      House to play tennis. Instead of playing they talked, and the set fell
      through, and after tea they disappeared, and Sally proposed not to disturb
      them, for they had gone, she said, to sit in the shade at the end of the
      garden. The marked mystery of the new flirtation piqued Frank's curiosity,
      and, striving to veil his question, he asked Sally who the young man was,
      and if her father knew he was coming to the Manor House.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He! Don't you know? That's the fellow we often speak of&mdash;the only
      fellow Maggie ever really cared for. He has just come back from America.
      He is going to begin business in London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sickening pain rose from his heart to his eyes, and he longed to place
      his hand on his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that is the man she is engaged to,&rdquo; he said, after a pause. &ldquo;I
      remember, now, you have spoken to me of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is not exactly engaged to him. Father would never hear of it; he
      hasn't a cent, and I believe he lost the little he had in America&mdash;now
      mind you must take care not to let out to father that he has been here;
      there would be the deuce of a row, and I promised Maggie not to tell any
      one; she has been nice to me lately, and I want to play fair with her if
      she will play fair with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I won't tell any one; I won't even let Maggie know that I know it was
      he.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn't matter about Maggie, she will tell you herself, no doubt; she
      doesn't mind your knowing. What do you think of him? Isn't he
      nice-looking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I confess I should never have thought of calling him handsome&mdash;would
      you? And do you think he is quite a gentleman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He seems to me to be all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, yes, but isn't there a something? You can see he is in trade&mdash;all
      the trading people look alike, at least so I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we are in trade, and I think he is quite as good as we are. But you
      seem quite put out. Would you like to take his place? I didn't know you
      were in love with Maggie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know that I am in love with her. I like her very much; but, love
      or no love, I don't think it is right for her to walk round the garden
      alone with that fellow the whole afternoon. I don't think it is very
      polite to me, and she knows her father does not like&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you mustn't say anything to father; mind you have promised me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I shan't say anything about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frank longed to get up from the tea-table and rush after Maggie. His heart
      ached to see her. He trembled lest she loved the man she was with, and
      rejoiced and took courage from the knowledge that she had not formally
      pledged herself to him. Frank was the romantic husband, not the lover; he
      found neither charm nor excitement in change; his heart demanded one
      single, avowed, and binding faith. He could take a woman who had sinned to
      his heart, and admit her to all his trust, for stolen kisses and illicit
      love were unfelt and imperfectly understood by him, and were considered as
      shadows and thin fancies, and not as facts full of mental consequences. He
      answered Sally in monosyllables, and on the first opportunity he pleaded
      letters to write, and withdrew. The gladness he felt that Maggie was truly
      not engaged to this fellow quickened and dominated his regret that the
      girls were inclined to behave so indiscreetly. The moment Mr. Brookes
      turned his back it began&mdash;that perpetual going and coming of men&mdash;it
      really wasn't right. Sally was a coarser nature, but Maggie! He might
      speak to Mr. Brookes; no, that wouldn't do. He might speak to Willy; but
      Willy didn't care&mdash;he was absorbed in his wife and his speculations.
    </p>
    <p>
      His little dinner at Mrs. Heald's passed in irritation and discomfort, and
      after dinner he stood at the window, his brain full of Maggie&mdash;her
      graces, her fascinating cunning, and all her picturesqueness. He knew
      nothing yet of his passion, nor did he think he could not bear to lose her
      until he went from the stuffy cottage towards his studio thinking of his
      portrait of her. He wanted to muse on the little eyes as he had rendered
      them. He saw the faults in the drawing hardly at all, and his pain
      softened and almost ceased when he took up the violin, but when he put it
      down the flow of subjective emotion ceased, and he stared on the concrete
      and realistic image of his thought&mdash;Maggie passing through the shade
      with the young stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who was he? By whose authority was he there? Was he one of those men whose
      only pleasure is to tempt girls, to corrupt them? Had he thought of this
      before his duty would have been to interpose; and he saw himself striding
      down the garden and telling Maggie that he insisted on her coming back to
      the verandah to her sister. It did not matter if he had no right, he was
      prepared to answer for his conduct to her father and brother. Did that man
      look like one of those men who are always sitting with girls in far
      corners out of sight? Ah, if he were sure that he was one of those
      dastardly ruffians he would seek him out, force him to speak his
      intentions. If a girl's father and brother will not look after her, a
      friend must say &ldquo;I will.&rdquo; Yes, he would have to thrash him, kill him, if
      it were necessary. She might hate him for it at first, but in the end she
      would recognise him as her saviour.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was too late now, the man was in Brighton. To-morrow? Elated with what
      he deemed &ldquo;duty,&rdquo; with what he deemed &ldquo;for the sake of the girl,&rdquo; he
      strode about, thinking of &ldquo;the ruffian&rdquo;; no thought came to him of how
      much of the sin, if sin there was, had originated in Maggie; he saw her
      merely as a poor little thing, led like a lamb. Following the idea of
      saving came the idea of possession. When she clung to the husband she
      would tremble at the danger she had escaped. Their home, their table,
      their fireside; protection from evil, now all wild winds might rage&mdash;they
      would be safe. The vision was constitutional and characteristic of his
      soul. He was out of thought of all but himself, his dream evolved in pure
      idea, removed from and independent of all limitations&mdash;out of concern
      of the world's favour&mdash;Mount Rorke, Mr. Brookes, or even the girl's
      grace. As this temper passed, as reality again interposed, and as he saw
      the garden with Maggie leaving him for another, he viewed her conduct
      suddenly in relation to himself. What did she mean by treating him so, and
      for whom? One day he would be Lord Mount Rorke! The Brookes knew nobody.
      He had only met a lot of cads at their house; they did not know any one
      but cads. The Brookes were cads! The father was a vulgar old City man, who
      talked about money and bought ridiculous pictures. The girls, too, were
      vulgar and coarse. God only knew how many lovers they had not had. Willy
      was the best of the bunch, but he was a fool. His miserliness and his
      vegetable shop&mdash;hateful! The whole place was hateful; he wished he
      had never come there; since he had been there he had never been treated
      even as a gentleman. The Brookes had treated him shamefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      The skeleton of Frank's soul is easy to trace in this mental crisis&mdash;his
      quixotism, his wish to sally forth and save women, his yearning for a
      pretty little wife, who would sit on his knee and kiss him, saying, &ldquo;Poor
      old boy, you are tired now;&rdquo; therefore an emotional and distorted
      apprehension of things, a tendency to think himself a wronged and
      persecuted person, and under much bravado and swagger the cringe that is
      so inveterate in the Celt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning he thought of her lightly, without bitterness and almost
      without desire; but after breakfast his heart began to ache again. He
      strove to read, he went to his studio, he went to Brighton; but he saw
      Maggie in all things. She was with him&mdash;a sort of vague pain that
      kept him strangely conscious of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once convinced he was a lover he became the man with a mission; his heart
      swelled with mysterious promptings, and felt the spur of duty. No longer
      was delay admissible. A day, an hour might involve the loss of all. Should
      he go round to the Manor House and tell Maggie of the message he had
      received to love her and save her? She would now be watering her flowers
      in the green-houses. But that other fellow might be there&mdash;he had
      heard something about an appointment. No, he had better write. If he wrote
      at once, absolutely at once, he would be in time for the six o'clock
      delivery. Snatching a sheet of paper he wrote:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAREST MAGGIE,&mdash;I have loved you a long while, I remember many
      things that make me think that I have always loved you; but to-day I have
      learnt that you are the one great and absorbing influence&mdash;that
      without you my life would be stupid and meaningless, whereas with you it
      shall be a joy, an achievement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have frittered away much time; my efforts in painting and poetry have
      been lacking in strength and persistency. I have vacillated and wandered,
      and I did not know why; but now I know why&mdash;because you were not by
      me to encourage me, to help me by your presence and beauty. I will not
      speak of the position I offer you&mdash;I know it is unworthy of you. I
      would like to give you a throne; but, alas, I can but promise you a
      coronet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His hand stopped and he raised his eyes from the paper. He recollected the
      day he saw her a child, the day they went blackberrying over the hills. He
      saw her again, she was older and prettier, and she wore a tailor-cut cloth
      dress. How pretty she looked that day, and also when she wore that summer
      dress, those blue ribbons. All the colour, innocence, and mirth of his
      childhood came upon him sweetly, like an odour that passes and recalls. He
      sighed, and he murmured, &ldquo;She is mine by right, all this could not have
      been if she were not for me.&rdquo; Ah! how he longed to sit with her, even at
      her feet, and tell her how his life would be but worship of her. He
      regretted that he was not poor, for to unite himself more closely to her
      he would have liked to win her clothes and food by his labour; and hearing
      himself speaking of love and seeing her as a maiden with the May time
      about her, his dreams drifted until the ticking of the clock forced him to
      remember that he could tell her nothing now of all his romance, so with
      pain and despair at heart he wrote,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never before did I so ardently feel the necessity of seeing you, of
      sharing my soul with you, and yet now is the moment when I say, I must
      end. But let this end be the beginning of our life of love, devotion, and
      trust. I will come to-night to see you; I will not go into the
      billiard-room, but will walk straight to the drawing-room. Do be there.
      Dearest Maggie, I am yours and yours only.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seized his hat and rushed to the post. He was in time, and now that the
      step had been taken, he walked back looking more than usually handsome and
      tall, pleased to see the children run out of school and roll on the grass,
      pleased to linger with the General.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going, sir?&rdquo; said the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going to my studio to play the fiddle. Will you come? I'll give you a
      glass of sherry, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never touch anything, except at meals. I used to when I was as young as
      you, but not now. But I will go and hear a little music.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glad to have a companion, Frank took out the violin, and he played all the
      melodies he knew; and his mind ran chiefly on Schubert and Gounod. The
      &ldquo;Soir,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Printemps,&rdquo; and &ldquo;La Chanson du Printemps&rdquo; carried his soul
      away, nor could he forbear to sing when he came to the phrase, &ldquo;La Neige
      des Pommiers.&rdquo; When musical emotion ran dry he tried painting, but with
      poor result. During dinner he grew fevered and eager to see Maggie, and
      mad to tell her that he loved her, and could love none but her. At
      half-past eight the torture of suspense was more than he could endure, and
      he decided that he would go to the Manor House. He passed round the block
      of cottages, and got into the path that between the palings led through
      the meadows. It was a soft summer evening&mdash;moonlight and sunset
      played in gentle antagonism, and in a garden hat he saw Maggie coming
      towards him. He noticed the pink shawl about her shoulders, and the
      thought struck him, &ldquo;had she come to ask him to elope.&rdquo; She stopped, and
      she hesitated as if she were going to turn back again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am so sorry,&rdquo; she said, speaking with difficulty, &ldquo;but I wanted you
      to get this before nine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, darling,&rdquo; he answered, smiling; &ldquo;you can tell me all about it&mdash;it
      will be sweeter to hear you talk. Which way shall we go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really don't think I can now; father doesn't know I am out. This letter
      will&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; I cannot bear to part with you. How pretty you look in that hat!
      Come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Frank, I cannot now, and you had better leave me. I cannot walk with
      you to-night. Read this letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then am I&mdash;is it really so?&rdquo; said Frank, growing suddenly pale. &ldquo;You
      will not have me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must read this letter, it will tell you all. I am truly sorry, but I
      did not know you cared for me&mdash;at least not like that. I don't think
      I could, I really don't. But I don't know what I am saying. How
      unfortunate it was meeting you. I but thought to run round and leave the
      letter, it would have explained all better than I could. We have known you
      so long. You will forgive me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stood with the letter in her hand. He snatched it a little
      theatrically and tore it open. She watched, striving to read the effect of
      her words in his face. They dealt in regrets. There was an exasperating
      allusion to engaged affections. There was a long and neatly-worded
      conclusion suggesting friendship. She had taken a great deal of trouble
      with the composition, and was very fearful as to the result. She felt she
      could not marry him&mdash;at least, not just at present, she didn't know
      why. Altogether Frank's proposal had puzzled and distressed her. She felt
      she must see her flirtation out with Charlie, but at the same time she did
      not want to utterly lose Frank, or worse still, perhaps, to hand him over
      to Sally. She was determined that Sally should not be Lady Mount Rorke,
      and she thrilled a little when she saw he would not give her up easily,
      and her heart sank when she thought of the difficulty of continuing her
      intrigue without prejudicing her future. If Frank would only leave
      Southwick for a little while.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this all? The meaning is clear enough; it means that you love the man
      I saw yesterday at the Manor House. But he shall not have you; I will save
      you from him. Listen to me&mdash;I swear he shall not have you; I will
      strive to outwit him by every means in my power. If I don't get you, none
      shall. I will shoot the man rather than he should get you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Frank, you wouldn't commit murder!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would, for you; but it will not be necessary. I can challenge him to
      fight a duel, and if he is cowardly enough to refuse, I will horsewhip him
      before your face, and I don't suppose you will marry him after that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maggie struggled with feelings of laughter, fear, and delight; delight
      overpowered laughter, for Frank was young and handsome, and full of what
      he said. It was quite romantic to be talked to like that. She would like
      to see the men threaten each other. But then&mdash;the scandal&mdash;father
      might never get over it. And if he married again? Speaking slowly, and in
      an undertone so as not to betray herself, she said: &ldquo;O Frank, I'm sure you
      would not do anything that would injure me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My darling, I love you better than the whole world. My whole life, if you
      will, shall be spent in striving to make you happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very good.&rdquo; She took his hand and squeezed it; he returned the
      pressure with rapturous look and motion. She drew from him a little, for
      there were some people coming towards them, and she said: &ldquo;Take care.&rdquo;
       When the fisher folk had passed, she looked at him stealthily. She had
      always liked him in that necktie, and those cloth shoes were perfect. Had
      she never known Charlie, or if she had not gone so far with him!&mdash;There
      was something in Frank that was very nice&mdash;she could like the two.
      What a pity the two were not one! &ldquo;If he were always as nice as he is now,
      and not lecture me!&rdquo; Then she remembered she must return home. &ldquo;I must
      really go home; I can't go any farther&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, I cannot leave you. I must see and hear you now. If you knew what
      I have endured waiting for you, you would not be so cruel. Come and let us
      sit on the beach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn't. I must go back; father will miss me. Besides, what have we to
      say? If I were only free and could tell you that I loved you, it would be
      different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Free! then you regret; if a woman wills it she can always free herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it is harder than you think for a girl to get out of an engagement
      she has entered into, even if no absolute promise has been given.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean? If you have entered into no formal engagement you are
      surely free.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know. Do you think so? I am afraid men think that a promise may
      be broken after marriage as well as before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are wrong. Women who are jealous, who are old, tell girls that men
      are always unfaithful, but I'm sure that if I loved a girl I could never
      think of another. Do you really think I could think of any girl but you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know. I wonder if all you say is true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think me different from other men?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but I cannot go on the beach; some other evening I will walk there
      with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, now, now&mdash;I want to tell you how and when I began to love. Do
      you remember when I used to spend part of my holidays at the Manor House
      when I was only so high, and you were all in short frocks? Come, there is
      much I want to say to you; I cannot part with you. Come, and let us sit on
      the shingle. Oh, the beautiful evening!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She could love him a little when she looked at him, but when he talked she
      lost interest in him. She had allowed him to take her hand, he had bent
      towards her, and she had let him kiss her; and then they talked of love&mdash;she
      of its bitterness and disappointments; he of its aspirations, and
      gradually their souls approached like shadows in the twilight, paused for
      a few vague moments, seemed as if lost in dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall never forget this night! O my love, tell me one day you will be
      mine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot promise, you must not ask me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are meant for each other. It was not blind fate that cast us together.
      Does no voice tell you this? I hear it in my heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The abandonment, the mystery of the gathering dusk, touched Maggie's
      fancy. They were alone in the twilight, and it was full of the romance of
      a rising tide.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never did I know such happiness; I am supremely happy, alone with you
      beneath this sky, listening to the vague, wild voice of the sea. It would
      be bitter sweet to die in such a triumphant hour. Supposing wewere to lie
      here and allow the sea to take us away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don't want to die. I want to live and enjoy my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The answer fell a little chillingly on Frank's rapture. Then after a
      pause, Maggie said: &ldquo;I think I have read of that somewhere&mdash;in anovel&mdash;lovers
      caught by the tide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I daresay you have. I was thinking of two lovers who were so
      overcome with happiness that they decided that they would not trust
      themselves again to the waves and storms of life, but would let the calm,
      slow tide of death take them away with all their happiness unassoiled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maggie did not answer. The double fear had come upon her&mdash;first, that
      the tide might rise higher than usual and cut off their retreat. Secondly,
      that Frank&mdash;he was a poet&mdash;might insist on remaining there and
      being drowned. Getting up, she said: &ldquo;I do not know what father will say
      when I get home, really it is quite dark. Come, Frank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Death is better than a life of abomination&mdash;loss of innocence, and
      of delight in simple things. I ask you,&rdquo; he said, stopping her suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, no doubt it is so; but I want to get home. Do go on, Frank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will save you from a life of abomination&mdash;in other words I will
      save you from him; he shall not get you. I have sworn it; you did notknow
      that when you were lying down on the beach&mdash;you had ceased speaking,
      and in the silence my life seemed stirred to its very essence; and I knew
      that I must struggle against him, and conquer. I want to know this: Have
      you ever thought of what your life would be with him? Have you ever
      thought what he is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you don't know him, Frank. You have never spoken to him. I am sure
      you misjudge him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think I cannot see what he is? He is one of those men whose one
      ambition is to make themselves friendly in a house where there are women
      to wheedle. If the wife is young he will strive to wheedle her, and though
      he may not succeed he must degrade her. Or, if she have daughters, he will
      never cease to appeal to, to work upon, to excite latent feelings which,
      had it not been for him, would never have been developed into base and
      abnormal desire. I know what the foul-minded beast is. Such men as he
      ought to be killed; we don't want them in our society. I want to save you,
      I want to give you a noble, a pure life, full of the charms of a husband's
      influence, a home where there would be love of natural things. You are
      capable of all this, Maggie, your nature is a pure one, but your life is
      unwholesome and devoid of purity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frank, how can you speak so? You have no right to say such things about
      us. I am sure you have always been well treated&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not understand me, I will explain what I mean. Your life is rich
      and luxurious, but you are not happy, no one is happy in idleness; above
      all no woman is happy without love. A woman's mission in life is to love,
      she must have her home, her husband, and her children. These are the
      things that make a woman happy; and these are the things I want to give
      you&mdash;that I will give you; for, listen to me, I swear you shall not
      have that adventurer. He would degrade you with pleasure at first, and
      afterwards with neglect. You are too good for this, Maggie&mdash;it must
      not be, it shall not be. As I said before, death would be better.&rdquo; They
      stood in front of the canal locks and Maggie looked with a beating heart
      on the deep water that a ray from a crescent moon faintly indicated. &ldquo;A
      woman is helpless until she finds her lord, he who shall save, the saviour
      who shall bring her home safe to the fold. He exists! and all are in
      danger till they find him. Some miss him&mdash;they wander into misery and
      ruin; those that find him are led to happiness and content. I am yours. I
      would tell you how I became convinced that I am the one appointed by God
      to lead you to Him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you didn't believe in God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not as we have been taught to understand Him but I believe in a presiding
      power&mdash;call it luck, fate, or destiny that&mdash;that exists and
      wills; that is to say, watches over&mdash;rules out that this man is for
      that woman, and ordains that he shall protect her from danger, shall save
      her from those that seek her destruction. Much has happened to prove that
      I was intended for you. We have known each other since we were children.
      Do you not remember when I kissed you in the verandah as I was going to
      school? I was the first man who kissed you; you were the first woman who
      kissed me&mdash;have you never felt that we were for each other? Nor can I
      forget that when I thought we had drifted for ever apart, that I was
      brought back. Do you think it was accident&mdash;blind chance? I don't.
      Now I see this man striving to win you, and whether it be for your money,
      whether it be for yourself, or for both, it is my duty to say: No, this
      must not be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you are mistaken about Charlie. I admit that a man is often a
      better judge than a girl; and as for you, Frank, I am sure I am very fond
      of you. It is very good of you to take such interest in me&mdash;but we
      must get home. I don't know what father will think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, before you go a step further you must promise me not to see that man
      again. I cannot tell you how, but I know no good can come of it. He is one
      of those creatures who cannot love, and only care for women for the
      excitement they afford. I know what sort of brute he is. It is more
      depraving to walk alone with him, than to be the mistress of a man who
      loved you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is leaving Brighton in a few days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the better for all of us. But you must promise me. I would sooner
      see you lying drowned in that lock than his wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maggie trembled. It was ridiculous to think of such a thing. Surely he did
      not mean to drown her if she refused to promise. Charlie was going to
      London in a few days; he would be away for three or four months. Heaven
      only knows what would happen in that time. She didn't see what right Frank
      had to bully her&mdash;to extort promises from her by night on the edge of
      a dangerous lock. But a promise wasn't much, and a promise given in such
      circumstances was not a promise at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are really in earnest&mdash;if you think it is for my good, I'll
      promise you not to see him again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Maggie, if you only knew what a load of trouble you have taken off my
      mind! Thank you&mdash;give me your hand, and let me thank you. I know I am
      right. And now, tell me, can you love me? Will you marry me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will promise nothing more to-night; we shall see how you behave
      yourself,&rdquo; the girl replied winningly. &ldquo;And now go on, sir, we have been
      here quite long enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He crossed the gate mechanically, she followed eagerly, and when she
      reached the other side her heart beat with pride at her pretty triumph.
      Now I'll twit him, she thought, as they ascended the shore and entered the
      town.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder why you think Charlie so wicked; I think if you knew him you
      would change your opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very thankful indeed that I do not know him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The conversation dropped, but a moment after he gave her the chance she
      wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mind you have promised me not to see him again. I trust you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But suppose he calls and if I should be in the drawing-room, I cannot
      walk out of the room without speaking to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you had better write and say you do not wish to see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn't do that; we have known him a long time, and father has always
      said that we must be rude to no one. Besides, what reason could I give?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need not give a reason. But let that pass. I can't see why you should
      meet; you can surely tell your servant to say 'Not at home,' when he
      calls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might be in the garden&mdash;Sally would not allow it. If John said
      'Not at home,' she would run down and let him in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see you are raising difficulties&mdash;I see you do not intend to keep
      your promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been quite rude enough for one evening. You have kept me out on
      the beach by force till nearly ten o'clock at night, and you said that my
      life at the Manor House was not a pure one&mdash;I don't know what you
      mean. No man ever spoke to me like that before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You misunderstood me. If you knew how I loved you, you would not twit me
      with my own words. Heaven knows I would sooner go back and drown myself in
      the lock than do anything or say anything that would offend you. Remember
      also that I asked you to be my wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not the first. I daresay it may appear strange to you, but others
      have asked me the same question before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does not seem strange to me, it only seems strange to me that every
      one doesn't love you, but I daresay they do. O Maggie, remember that you
      gave me hope, you said that you might&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I? Well, it's too late to talk any more. Goodnight. I suppose you're
      not coming in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She left him in a cruel dispersal of hope. He avoided, and then he
      tenderly solicited a regret that he had not thrown her into the lock. To
      end on that hour by the sea would have been better than the trivial and
      wretched conclusion of a broken promise, and everything, even murder, were
      better than that a brute should have her woman's innocence to sully and
      destroy. His love of the woman disappeared in his desire to save, the idea
      which she represented at that moment; and lost in sentiment he stood
      watching the white sickle of the moon over against the dim village. The
      leaves of some pollarded willows whitened when the breeze shot them up to
      the light, and a moment after became quite distinct in the glare and the
      steam of an approaching engine. He might go and tell Willy all about it;
      he would ask him to interfere-could he catch that train? If he ran for it,
      yes. He ran full tilt across the green under the archway up the high stone
      steps. He just did it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the last train; he would sleep in Brighton. His plan, so far as he
      had a definite plan, was to ask Willy to come with him and tell &ldquo;that
      brute&rdquo; that his visits to the Manor House must end, and request him to pay
      his sister no further attentions. His other plans were&mdash;Willy must
      speak to Maggie and tell her all he knew of the man; Willy must speak to
      his father; Mr. Brookes must not be kept in ignorance. But of course the
      right thing to do would be for Willy and him to call at the brute's hotel,
      tell him what they thought, and give him a licking. The train jogged on,
      and Frank made plan after plan. It was now past eleven, and he would not
      be at East Street before twelve o'clock. As he hurried along the streets
      he doubted more than ever how Willy would receive him. He might just as
      well have waited till morning. However, it was too late now to think of
      going back, there was no train, and he rapped at first timidly and then
      noisily at the shop door. He had to wait some time, and then he heard a
      voice asking from the top windows who was there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tis I, Frank; awfully sorry, but must see you&mdash;particular
      business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no answer; he heard the voice grumbling, and more than ever
      doubtful of the cordiality of his reception, he listened. The door opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tis I, Cissy; but I'm in my nightdress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't look at you, Cissy, if that's what you mean. But won't yougive me
      a kiss?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stoop down, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry for waking you up, Cissy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, I'd get up at any hour to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, run upstairs, and take care you don't catch cold, or I shall never
      hear the end of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father is in bed with mother. He says you are to go up, for if he were to
      get out of bed it might give him cold. You know his room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, here it is, now run along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frank was a little shocked, and he waited stupidly on the threshold. He
      could see a fragment of Mrs. Brookes's profile, and beneath the clothes
      the outline of Willy's bony body.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in, come in,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;don't stand there filling the room with cold
      air. Now, what is it? Why the deuce do you come here waking us up at this
      ungodly hour? What has happened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have proposed to your sister Maggie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure I am delighted to hear it, old chap; but I can't help thinking
      that I could have congratulated you equally as well, if not better, in the
      morning.&rdquo; Then, noticing the distressed look in Frank's face, he said: &ldquo;I
      hope she has not refused you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; she asked me to wait, she said it would depend&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you may depend it is all right; now go away and let me go to sleep,
      we'll talk about it in the morning. You can't get back to-night. You are
      sleeping in Brighton, I suppose? You'll come and breakfast here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, with pleasure, but it wasn't exactly to tell that I had proposed to
      Maggie that I came here to-night; there is something more than that. You
      know that fellow she calls Charlie? I don't know his other name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stracey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say. I mean the man you said you hated more than any man alive; I
      hate him, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't mean to say she is still thinking of that fellow. Has he come
      back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was at the Manor House all day yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she marries that fellow I'll never speak to her again, it will be dead
      cuts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is only natural that I should love Maggie. You remember the first day
      I came down to the Manor House? How young I was then&mdash;how young we
      all were; there are no days like the old days! There is a beautiful poem
      by Wordsworth; I only remember one line now&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;'When every day was long
       As twenty days are now'&mdash;
</pre>
    <p>
      Do you remember the poem?&rdquo; Willy did not answer, and noticing that his
      eyes were blinking, Frank hastily returned to more recent events.&rdquo; I wrote
      to her this afternoon telling her how much I loved her, and I said that I
      would call about nine in the evening at the Manor House, and that I hoped
      to find her in the drawing-room where we could talk without being
      disturbed. However, I was too excited, and could not hold out till nine; I
      thought I had better hear my fate at once, and as I was walking across the
      field&mdash;you know, at the back of Mrs. Heald's&mdash;I met her half
      way. She had a letter in her hand, which she said she was going to leave
      at Mrs. Heald's for me&mdash;She admitted that the letter was in point of
      fact a refusal, and when I questioned her she admitted that she was
      obliged to refuse me because she had half promised Charlie. We went for a
      walk on the beach; we sat on the beach and watched the sunset, and I told
      her all. I spoke to her about the past, how we had grown up together&mdash;how
      we had been, as it were, from the first fated for each other; for you must
      admit, Willy, that it is very curious&mdash;I don't know if you ever think
      of it, but I do&mdash;how we have met again even when the chances of life
      seemed to have put us for ever apart. &ldquo;Here a slight sound warned Frank
      that the present moment was one as equally unfitted for psychological
      analysis as for poetry, and he hurried to his story, hoping that the
      incident of the lock would secure him attention. &ldquo;Willy, I think I
      convinced her that I liked her better than that other fellow. We were
      standing by the lock&mdash;Willy, I really do think you might listen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow, I am listening. You were both looking at the sunset.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It really is too bad. Of course, if you don't want to hear, and would
      prefer to go to sleep, you have only to say so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow, I assure you I wasn't asleep. I only closed my eyes
      because I can't bear the glare of that candle. I know where you were&mdash;you
      were looking at the sunset.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, we weren't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weren't they, Jessie? Are you asleep?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I am not asleep. Do hold your tongue, Willy, I want to hear the
      story. You were standing by the lock, Mr. Escott.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes, so they were.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I felt it was my duty, so I told her that I felt it was my mission to
      save&mdash;to save her from that man, and I made her promise me not to see
      him again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it is all right. Nobody can be more glad than I am. I hate the
      fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will not keep her promise. Of course she may only have done it to
      tease me; but as we were going home she said she could not walk out of the
      room if she happened to be there when he called, nor could she leave word
      with the servants to say that they were not at home. She made a lot of
      excuses. What are you laughing at, Mrs. Brookes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am really very sorry, Mr. Escott, but I couldn't help wondering if she
      would change her mind again if you were to go back to the lock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frank took up the candle and turned to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't go,&rdquo; Willy murmured faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very sorry, Mr. Escott&mdash;if circumstances permitted, I would do
      all I could to help you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was delicate ground, and Willy woke up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want me to do? Have you anything to suggest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it struck me that we might both go round to the fellow's hotel&mdash;Stracey,
      you call him, I think&mdash;and you might tell him that his visits must
      cease at the Manor House, and that he must not speak to your sister if he
      should happen to meet her. That should bring the matter to an end. He is
      in Brighton&mdash;he is staying at the 'Grand.' We might go round there
      to-morrow morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He might kick us out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only hope he may try. I would give him such a hammering. But you need
      not be afraid of that. It wouldn't do to have Maggie's name mentioned in
      connection with a vulgar brawl&mdash;people are not too charitable. My
      idea is that this business should be conducted in the quietest and most
      gentlemanly manner possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I had better speak to father first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No necessity; he will be only too glad to get rid of the penniless brute.
      Don't you think so, Mrs. Brookes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They then spoke of other things&mdash;of the shop, the profit they had
      made on tomatoes, and the losses that had resulted from over-stocking
      themselves with flour. At last a loud snore brought the conversation to a
      full stop, and Frank hurriedly bade them good-night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cissy will let you out,&rdquo; said Willy, with a sigh of relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little girl had pulled on her stockings and tied a petticoat round her
      waist. &ldquo;So you are going to be married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Cissy, you have been listening!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she very nice? She must be very nice for you to marry her. I should
      like to marry you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you, Cissy, and why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, because you are so very handsome. But you will come and see us all
      the same, and let me sit on your knee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I will, Cissy, and now good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Next morning Willy declared himself ready to go and see Mr. Charles
      Stracey, and to tell him that he was not to call any more at the Manor
      House, or speak to Miss Brookes if he should happen to meet her. Frank
      wondered if this decision was owing to Mrs. Brookes's influence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I slept last night at the 'Grand' It seemed odd sleeping in the same
      house&mdash;perhaps within a few doors of him. If you only knew how I love
      her, if I could only tell you, you would pity me. You ought to know what I
      feel&mdash;the anxiety, the heart-ache. I know you have gone through it
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think I know what it is,&rdquo; Willy replied thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Stracey is staying here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you enquire at the office, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While the books were being searched the young men consulted together.
      Frank said: &ldquo;Send up your card, and say you will be glad to speak to him
      on a matter of importance. Of course he will see you, but before you speak
      about Maggie you must apologise for my presence; you must say that I am a
      very particular friend, and that you thought it better that the interview
      should take place in the presence of a witness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish it were all over. I wouldn't do what I am doing for any one else,
      I can tell you, Frank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Stracey is in the hotel, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you give him my card, and say I should be glad to speak to him on a
      matter of importance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      (In an undertone to Frank), &ldquo;Was that right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, one thing I had forgotten to ask you&mdash;am I to shake hands with
      him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean if he offers you his hand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is impossible to settle everything beforehand. One must act according
      as the occasion requires.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all very well for you, but I am a slow man, and am lost if I don't
      arrange beforehand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretend not to see his hand, and apologise for my presence; he will then
      see that we mean business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The waiting is the worst part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you walk this way, sir?&rdquo; said the page boy. &ldquo;Mr. Stracey is not out
      of bed yet, but he said if you wouldn't mind, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They shrank from their enterprise instinctively, but the door was thrown
      open, and they saw a bath, and a sponge, and a towel, and Mr. Stracey
      lying on his back reading <i>The Sporting Times</i>. He extended a long
      brawny arm. The strength of the arm fixed itself on Willy's mind, and he
      doubted if he had not better take the proffered hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I brought my friend Mr. Escott with me, for I thought a witness&mdash;I
      mean, that this interview should be conducted in the presence of a third
      party.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this speech Charlie opened his eyes and dropped his paper. Willy leaned
      over the rail of the bed; Frank looked into the bath, but remembering
      himself suddenly, he examined the chest of drawers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come to speak to you about my sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Charlie changed countenance, and both men noticed the change.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean to say I have come to tell you that you must discontinue your
      visits to the Manor House, and I must beg of you not to address my sisters
      should you meet them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I ask if you are your father's representative, if you speak with his
      authority?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not. I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I should like to know on what authority you forbid me a house that
      doesn't belong to you, and I should like to know, if your father doesn't
      disapprove of my knowing your sisters, why you should? I shall speak to
      Miss Brookes as long as she cares to speak to me. The very idea of a man
      like you coming here to bully me! You have got my answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If, after this warning,&rdquo; said Frank, who, seeing that things were going
      against them, thought he had better interfere, &ldquo;you speak to Miss Brookes,
      you will do so at your peril.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peril! What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean that you must be prepared to take the consequences.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you? I should like to know what you have to do in this matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I speak as Miss Brookes's future husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Future husband be damned! She'll never marry you,&rdquo; said Charlie,
      springing out of bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank threw himself on his guard, and they would have struck each other if
      Willy had not cried out: &ldquo;Frank, remember you promised me there must be no
      scandal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had almost forgotten. For Miss Brookes's sake, I refrain. Do you also,
      for her sake, cease to provoke me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Charlie hesitated for a moment, then rushing to the door, he said: &ldquo;I,
      too, for Miss Brookes's sake, refrain, and I give you three seconds to
      clear out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In attempting to carry out the injunction Willy nearly fell in the bath.
      Frank had to bite his lip to avoid a smile, and he stalked out of the room
      assuming his most arrogant air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, on the whole, we got the best of it,&rdquo; he said as they went down
      stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you? He turned us out of his room!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the worst of tackling a man in his own room&mdash;if he tells you
      to go, and you don't go, he can ring for the servants.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was as nearly as possible going into the bath.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, a touch more and down you'd have gone.&rdquo; Frank laughed, and Willy
      laughed, &ldquo;and that fellow in his nightshirt fishing you out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don't, don't&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frank asked Willy to lunch with him at Mutton's, and he ordered a bottle
      of champagne in honour of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, just fancy pulling you out of the bath, and wiping you with a
      towel. I can see you dripping!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't set me off again. Let me enjoy my cutlets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove! there's something I hadn't thought of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must be off. We must tell Maggie what has happened before he has time
      to communicate with her. What is the next train to Southwick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's one at half-past one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was after twelve when we saw him, he won't have time to catch that. We
      must be off. Waiter, the bill, and be quick. Look sharp, Willy, finish the
      bottle, pity to waste it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a nuisance women are, to be sure. Just as I was enjoying my cutlet!
      I can't walk fast in this weather, I should make myself ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must take a cab.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a fellow you are, you never think of the expense. I don't know where
      I should be if I were as reckless as you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Supposing he were at the station. It would be rather a sell if we went
      down by the same train! What should we do? He would surely never attempt
      to force his way in!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think he would attempt that. If he did, we should have to send
      for the police.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young men strove to decide how the news should be broken to Maggie.
      But they had arranged nothing before they arrived at Southwick, and Frank
      stopped Willy time after time by the footpath, until at last in despair
      the latter said: &ldquo;We must make haste; there's another train in twenty
      minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove! I had not thought of that; we must get on. Well, then, it is all
      arranged. You must tell her that you thought it your duty. Put it all down
      to duty, and it was your duty to do what you did&mdash;putting entirely
      out of the question the service you did me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can tell you what, Frank, I am very sorry I ever meddled in the matter.
      Had I known the vexation and annoyance it would have caused&mdash;and mark
      my words, and see if they don't come true, we are only commencing the
      annoyances that the affair will cause us. Ah, had I only foreseen! What a
      fool I was; I ought to have known better; I have had nothing but bad luck
      all my life. It is perfectly wonderful the bad luck I have had; no matter
      what I did, nothing seemed to go right. I dare say if you had gone to see
      that fellow without me it would have turned out differently. But I don't
      see how I am to tell my sister point blank that I have forbidden him the
      house. What will she say? She may fly at me. Women have queer tempers,
      particularly when you interfere with their young men. My sisters have the
      very worst of tempers; you don't know them as I do. Fortunately it is not
      Sally. I assure you I wouldn't face Sally with such news for all the money
      you could give me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very sorry, old chap, but we must now go through it. You must forbid
      her to communicate with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She won't heed what I say. It will only excite her. She will fly at me,
      and call me names, and burst into tears. I should not be surprised if she
      went off her head&mdash;she has been very strange once before. I don't
      mean to say she was ever wrong in her head, but she is a nervous,
      excitable girl&mdash;most excitable; my sisters are the most excitable
      girls I have ever known.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was surprisingly soon over. Willy had not spoken a dozen words, when he
      was interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean to say you have been to call on him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and we told him he was never to speak to you again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frank expected her eyes to flash fire, but he only noticed a slight change
      in her face, a movement of the muscles of the lower jaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I will speak to neither of you again!&rdquo; and she walked out of the
      room, and in dismay they listened to her going upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She didn't fly at me,&rdquo; said Willy; and, looking a little terrified, he
      stroked his moustache softly. &ldquo;I told you she would give no heed to what
      we said; nor do I see how we can prevent her seeing that fellow if she
      chooses. He cannot come into the house, it is true, but she can go out
      when she pleases.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must follow her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Conscious of defeat, Willy desired compromise. He could not be induced to
      take a share of watching and following which Frank declared essential;
      and, dreading an encounter with Stracey, whose brawny arm it was
      impossible to forget, he shut himself up in the shop, and devoted himself
      to drawing up a most elaborate balance-sheet, showing how he would stand
      if he were obliged to close the business to-morrow, whereas Frank loitered
      about the roads, till Mrs. Horlock came along with her dogs, and engaged
      him in conversation; and no matter at what corner he stationed himself, he
      found he was not free from observation. A few days after he could not
      bring himself to return to his post, and contented himself with looking
      out of his window, and taking an occasional stroll by the embankment, when
      he saw a train signalled.
    </p>
    <p>
      A great weight seemed lifted from his shoulder the day he heard that his
      rival's holiday had come to an end, and that he had been forced to return
      to his counting-house in London. True it is that Mr. Brookes had in a
      certain measure approved of Willy's action in forbidding young Stracey the
      Manor House, and therefore of his, Frank Escott's, suit, but neither of
      these gains compensated him for the crowning loss of not being able to see
      his beloved, for although the Manor House was still theoretically open to
      him, practically it was closed. The sisters, although at variance on all
      subjects, had united in condemning him and Willy, and during one dinner,
      the misery of which he declared he could never forget, they had sat
      whispering together, refusing to address him either by look or word. Willy
      took all this calmly. It is an ill wind that blows no good, and the
      silence enabled him to thoroughly masticate his food. Mr. Brookes wept a
      little and laughed a little, and reminded them of the oblivion that
      awaited all their little quarrels.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this, like much else in life, was ridiculous enough; but because we
      are ridiculous, it does not follow that we do not suffer, and Frank
      suffered. He was five-and-twenty, and light love had him fairly by the
      throat; he winced, and he cried out, but very soon his dignity gave way,
      and he craved forgiveness. But Maggie passed without heeding him. For more
      than a week she resisted all his appeals, and it was not until she saw
      that she was taking the neighbourhood into her confidence, and to feel
      that if she did not relent a little he might leave Southwick, and not
      return, she answered him with a monosyllable. With what bliss did he hear
      that first &ldquo;no,&rdquo; and how passionately he pleaded for a few words; it did
      not seem to matter what they were, so long as he heard her speak one whole
      sentence to him. Feeling her power, she was shy of yielding, and with
      every concession she drew him further into the meshes of love. He dined
      now nearly every day at the Manor House, and he spent an hour, sometimes
      two, with her in the morning or afternoon; he followed her from greenhouse
      to greenhouse, but all his efforts were in vain, and he failed not only to
      obtain her promise to marry him, but even a renewal of the feeble and
      partial hopes which she had given him that night on the beach. He prayed,
      he wept, he implored pity, he openly spoke of suicide, and he hinted at
      murder. But Maggie passed him, pushing him out of the way with the
      watering-pot, threatening to water him too, until one day he drew a
      revolver. She screamed, and the revolver was put away, but on the next
      occasion a stiletto that he had brought from Italy was produced, and with
      a great deal of earnestness life was declared to be a miserable thing. It
      was absurd, no doubt, but at the same time it was not a little pathetic;
      he was so good-looking, and so sincere. Maggie put down the watering-pot,
      and she would probably have allowed him to take her hand and kiss her, if
      he had not spoken roughly about Charlie, and called her conduct into
      question. So she told him she would not speak to him again, and she
      continued watering the flowers in silence. Amid vague remembrances of
      murders she had read of, Frank's words and behaviour remained present in
      her mind, and that evening when Willy, who rarely took the trouble to
      speak, much less to advise his sisters, told her that she might never get
      such a chance again, she said: &ldquo;I am not going to marry a madman to please
      your vanity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marry a madman! What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I call a man that who comes regularly to see a girl with a revolver
      in one pocket and a stiletto in the other, and threatens to leave himself
      wallowing in a pool of blood at her feet&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean to say he does that? You are clearly determined to drive the
      poor fellow out of his mind with your infernal coquetry. Well, women are
      the most troublesome, and I believe in many cases, the wickedest creatures
      on the face of God's earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shut up. Men who don't get on with women always abuse them; you are
      soured since Miss &mdash;&mdash;, the actress, jilted you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you ever dare mention that subject, I will never speak to you again.
      You know I don't break my word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you interfere in my affairs? You don't think of me when you go
      down to browbeat Charlie Stracey; you don't think of what would have been
      said of me had Frank hit him, and it had all come out in the papers.&rdquo;
       Maggie said no more; she saw she had gone too far. Willy sat puffing at
      his pipe; but when her father spoke of a certain investment that had not
      turned out as well as he had anticipated, he joined in the conversation,
      and she hoped her cruelty was forgotten.

    <h2>
      XII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Frank uttered a cry of surprise when he opened the studio door to his
      friend. It was his favourite complaint that Willy never came to see him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last, at last! This is the second time you have been in the place
      since it was finished, faithless friend!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow, you know it is not my fault. I have been very busy lately
      trying to get on with my accounts. There's not a room in the Manor House
      where I can work in; my sisters' things are everywhere, and they must not
      be interfered with&mdash;their ball-dresses, their birds, their work. My
      sisters think of nothing but pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Triss, go back, go to your chair, sir; I'll get the whip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Showing his fangs, the bull-dog retired; then with a hideous growl sprang
      upon his chair, and sat eyeing Willy's calves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot think what pleasure it can give you to keep such a brute. Even
      if I had my accounts finished, I don't think I should care to come here
      much. It isn't safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are quite mistaken. There's not a better-tempered dog alive than
      Triss; he wouldn't bite any one unless he attacked me. Give me a slap, and
      you'll see&mdash;I won't let him come near you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, I'd rather not. But he sometimes growls even at you, and shows
      his teeth, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's only a way of his, and when he does it I kick him. Come here,
      Triss&mdash;come here, sir!&rdquo; The dog approached slowly; he sat down and
      gave his paw to his master, but he did not cease to growl. &ldquo;There! We have
      had enough of you, go back to your chair. What will you take&mdash;a glass
      of Chartreuse&mdash;a cigarette?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, both if you will let me. I see you like pretty things,&rdquo; he said,
      admiring the tall legs of the table&mdash;early English&mdash;and the
      quaint glasses into which Frank poured the liqueur. &ldquo;You've got the place
      to look very nice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very different from what is was when the smith and his boisterous brood
      were here,&rdquo; and as if he intended an apt illustration of his words, he
      stretched his leg out on the white fur rug and surveyed his calf and red
      silk stocking. &ldquo;Just look at that dog, isn't he a beauty? I always think
      he looks well in that attitude, leaning his head over the rail. I began a
      picture of him the other day in a pose somewhat like that. I'll show it
      you.&rdquo; Frank propped his sketch against the leg of the sofa, and returned
      to his place on the sofa. &ldquo;What do you think of it? Your father said it
      was very like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is like him, but I can see no merit in it. I'm afraid of the brute. I
      can't help hating him, for he always looks as if he were going for my
      legs. What else have you been painting? Any pretty women about? I should
      admire them more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't been painting lately,&rdquo; he said, sighing a little
      melodramatically, as was his wont, &ldquo;I think I have been playing the piano
      more than anything else. I have composed something too, I don't think it
      bad, I'll play it to you: a dialogue between a gentleman and a lady. He
      speaks first, then she answers, then I blend the two motives, and that is
      what they both say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Willy sat enwrapped in his own thoughts, not having heard a note. Though
      he knew that Willy was incapable of judging of music, it disappointed him
      that his dialogue had passed unperceived. Then smiling, he struck a few
      notes, and Willy awoke. &ldquo;You haven't been listening,&rdquo; he said,
      reproachfully. &ldquo;You don't care for any music, except that little tune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do; I heard what you played, and I think it very pretty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Willy, I am the most miserable man in the world. Every hour, every minute
      of my life is a pain to me. I never knew before what you must have
      suffered, but I know now; it is a sickening feeling, it takes you by the
      throat, it rises in the throat, and you are almost suffocated. Last night
      I lay awake hour after hour thinking. I could see Maggie as plainly as I
      can see you&mdash;she looked down upon me out of space with strange,
      steadfast eyes, and my whole soul went out to her, and I cried to her that
      I loved her beyond all things; and we seemed to be so near each other; it
      seemed such an intimate and perfect communion of spirit and sense that I
      seemed, as it were, lifted out of actual life; I seemed to myself holier,
      purer, better than I had ever been before; I seemed to loose all that is
      gross and material in me, and to gain in all that is best and worthiest in
      man. Did you feel like that when you were in love?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know that I felt exactly like that. But never mind how I felt;
      you are too fond of alluding to that subject, it is a very painful one to
      me; you will make me regret that I ever told you anything about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry I mentioned it. It is strange, but when one suffers one likes
      to speak of and to compare with one's own the suffering that another has
      endured. Your sister treats me most cruelly. She has forgiven me that
      miserable business, but she refuses to hold out any hope that she will
      ever be my wife. I don't understand&mdash;I am utterly at sea. I don't
      believe for a moment that she cares for that horrid brute; he is gone
      away. She tells me she never cared for him. If so, I should like to learn
      your explanation of her conduct.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Willy stroked his moustache, apparently declining the responsibility of
      apologist; but his manner showed he had something on his mind, and Frank
      sought more eagerly than ever to enlist his sympathy and support.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have done everything I could to win her. I don't know why she should be
      so difficult to please. I am not bad looking, I am at least as good
      looking as that damned brute&rdquo; (here he paused to glance at himself in the
      glass and smooth the curls above his forehead). &ldquo;I am certainly quite as
      clever&rdquo; (here he thought of his painting, and his eye sought one of his
      pictures), &ldquo;and my position&mdash;I will not speak of that, it would be
      snobbish. Women have cared for me. I have told Maggie hundreds of times
      that I never could care for any but her. Fate seems to have specially
      marked us for each other. You must admit that there is something very
      remarkable in the way we have been brought together over and over again. I
      have told her that my life is worthless without her. The day before
      yesterday, when I was speaking to her, I burst into tears. That a man
      should cry, no doubt, seems to you very ridiculous but if you knew how I
      suffer you would pity me. I often think I shall commit suicide.&rdquo; Frank
      took the stiletto from his pocket. &ldquo;I don't mind telling you, when you
      knocked at the door I was lying on the sofa thinking it over. One stab
      just here and I should be at peace for ever. I told her so yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not fond of giving advice, as you know&mdash;I have quite enough to
      do to think about my own affairs&mdash;but as you have often spoken to me
      on this matter, and as you have asked me for my opinion and my help, I had
      better tell you that I differ entirely from you concerning the wisdom of
      the course you are pursuing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How's that?&rdquo; said Frank, at first surprised and then delighted at Willy's
      breaking from his reserve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I mean is, that I think you would be more successful if you would
      lay aside daggers and revolvers, and try to win her affection by patience
      and gentleness. Maggie was talking to me about it no later than last
      night, and I could see clearly that you frighten her with bluster. I am
      sure there are times when she dreads you; it must be a positive terror to
      her to sit with you alone&mdash;so it would be to any girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maggie is a very delicate and nervous girl, and it wouldn't surprise me
      if your threats to commit suicide seriously affected her health; you come
      with a revolver and a stiletto, and you ask her to marry you, and if she
      doesn't at once say yes, you abuse her, declaring all the time that you'll
      stab yourself with the revolver and shoot yourself with the stiletto&mdash;I
      beg your pardon, I mean&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, if you've come here only to turn me into ridicule&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you I didn't mean it&mdash;a slip of the tongue,&rdquo; and as their
      eyes met at that moment, neither could refrain from laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Admit that there is something in what I say. If you will behave a little
      more quietly&mdash;if you will talk to her nicely; leave off assuring her
      of your love, she knows all that already; have some patience and
      forbearance; you will see if before long she doesn't change towards you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His interest in the matter was a desire that his sister should not miss
      this chance of marrying the future Lord Mount Rorke. But Maggie felt too
      sure of Frank to resist the temptation to tantalise him; besides her moods
      were naturally various, and the first relapse into her former coldness was
      answered by a sudden reversion to threats of murder and suicide, and one
      summer evening about six o'clock, when Mrs. Horlock took her dogs out and
      stood at the corner waiting for Angel, a rumour was abroad that Mr. Escott
      had stabbed himself to the heart, and had fallen weltering in his blood at
      Miss Brookes's feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr Dickinson walked across the green, watched with palpitating anxiety
      from the corner of the Southdown Road. The General spoke to the farmer,
      and the farmer's pupil nudged the general dealer. Mrs. Horlock spoke to
      the grocers, and the owners of the baths declared they had just heard from
      their servant that the young man was not dead, but mortally wounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was, therefore, no doubt that Dr Dickinson was going to Mrs.
      Heald's, and would not turn to the right and walk to the station for the
      quarter-to-seven train; and expectation on this point ceasing, the group
      expressed its sympathy for the young man. Poor young man&mdash;and so
      good-looking too&mdash;what will she do if he should die?&mdash;and he
      must die&mdash;there was no doubt of it. Maria had met Mary&mdash;that was
      the housemaid at the Manor House&mdash;it was Mary who had mopped up the
      blood. She said there was a great pool right in the middle of the new
      carpet under the window&mdash;they were sitting there on the ottoman when
      he said suddenly, &ldquo;I have come to ask you to marry me; if you won't I must
      die.&rdquo; Notwithstanding this she continued to play with him&mdash;the cruel
      little minx! He could stand it no longer, and he pulled out a dagger he
      had brought from the East, and stabbed himself twice close to the heart.
      What will she do?&mdash;she is his murderer&mdash;to all intents and
      purposes she is his murderer&mdash;she will have to go into a convent&mdash;she
      won't go into a convent&mdash;she'll brazen it out. No one thinks much of
      those girls&mdash;the way Sally carried on with young Meason&mdash;it was
      disgraceful&mdash;they say she used to steal her father's money and give
      it to him&mdash;Dr Dickinson could tell fine tales.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then gossip ceased, and they were in doubt if they might intercept the
      doctor and obtain news of his patient when he left Mrs. Heald's. Some
      strolled about the green, pretending to be taking the air. Mrs. Horlock,
      however, had no scruples, and picking up Angel and calling to Rose and
      Flora, she walked straight to Mrs. Heald's, and was seen to go in. Some
      five minutes after she came out with the doctor. Frank was not dead, nor
      mortally wounded, nor even dangerously wounded, but he had had a very
      narrow escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said to him, 'You have had a very narrow escape.' The fact is&mdash;(I,
      of course, examined the weapon)&mdash;a small part of the point had been
      broken away; it was this that saved him. The first blow scarcely pierced
      his clothes; the second was more effective, it entered the flesh just
      above the heart, and I have no doubt if the steel had penetrated a quarter
      of an inch deeper that he would have killed himself. But so far as I can
      see at present, he will get over it without much difficulty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did it occur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About an hour ago, at the Manor House. It appears that he has gone there
      every day for the last three weeks to ask Miss Brookes to marry him; she,
      however, would not give him any definite answer&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Horrid girl!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never liked her; most deceitful; no doubt she flirted with him
      outrageously.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't say. I hear that he often threatened to kill himself, and to-day,
      to conclude, he pulled out his stiletto.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought it was a dagger he had brought from the East?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, the weapon they showed me was an Italian stiletto.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The grocer's daughter shuddered, her mother murmured, &ldquo;And for that girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We didn't know him. The Brookes never allow their friends to know any one
      in Southwick, but I have heard that he is an exceedingly nice&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will be Lord Mount Rorke, if his uncle doesn't marry again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must have been desperately in love; no one ever heard of such a thing
      before. It sounds like the Middle Ages&mdash;a stiletto!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what could he see in her? That's what I can't make out; can you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! there I can't assist you. I hope to be able to cure him of the
      stiletto wound, but Cupid's arrows are beyond me. They did not fly so
      thickly or strike so hard in my time.&rdquo; And, laughing, the doctor withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose that after this she will marry him; she never intended to let
      him slip through her fingers. I can see her face when she heard that
      another quarter of an inch and her chance of being Lady Mount Rorke was
      gone for ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I daresay he won't marry her now. It would serve her right. I should be
      so glad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so pouring their gall out upon the unfortunate Maggie, the
      tradespeople returned to their homes. The stiletto was so utterly
      unprecedented, and so complete a reversal of all conception of the chances
      of life at Southwick, that every one felt puzzled and dissatisfied, even
      when gossip had brought to light every circumstantial detail of the
      romantic story. Had the deed been done with a knife, with anything but a
      stiletto; had he hanged himself, or cut his throat with a razor, or shot
      himself with his revolver, the wonder of the Southwickians would not have
      been so excited. But a stiletto! And for a week an Italy of brigands and
      bravoes, and stealthy surprises haunted shadows of picturesque archways,
      an Italy of chromo-lithographed skies and draperies in the Southdown Road.
      Maggie was spoken of with alternate fear and hate; her wickedness seemed
      more than natural, and had the Southdown Road known anything of Italian
      opera, there is little doubt that Miss Brookes would have been compared to
      Lucretia Borgia. The young women looked out of their windows at night, and
      wondered how they'd feel if a troubadour were suddenly to sing to them
      from behind the privet hedges. The young men were even more impressed than
      their womenfolk; they cursed their place of birth and habitation, knowing
      that it incapacitated them from knowing her; they wasted their mothers'
      candles sitting up till two in the morning writing odes to cruel women
      with raven hair; and all gazed sadly on the old ship in the harbour, and
      the Spanish main seemed nearer, and those gallant days more realisable
      than they had ever been before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The direct cause of this revival of romance lived, however, unconscious of
      it. She was genuinely frightened. She said her prayers with great fervour,
      begging God that He might save Frank, and that she might not be a
      murderess. She made him soups, she sent him wine, she brought him books,
      and she sat with him for hours. She thought he had never looked so nice as
      now&mdash;so pale, so aristocratic, so elegantly weak, his head laid upon
      a cushion, which she had brought him, and when he took her hand and said,
      &ldquo;Will you, darling?&rdquo; and she murmured, &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; then it seemed that the
      happiness of his life was upon his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three days after Frank was sitting at his table writing to Mount Rorke,
      and on the following Sunday he walked to the Manor House to tell Mr.
      Brookes that he was engaged to his daughter, and to ask his consent. He
      did not think of his folly, he was too happy; he seemed like one in a
      quiet dulcet dream; he walked slowly, leaning from time to time against
      the wooden paling, for he wished to prolong this meditative moment; he saw
      everything vaguely, and loved all with a quiet fulness of heart; he took
      in the sense of this village and its life as he had never done before. He
      compared it with Ireland; Mount Rorke, with its towers, and lakes, and
      woods arose, and he was grateful that Maggie was going there, yet he was
      sure that he could not live without sometimes seeing this village where he
      had found so much happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wound had sucked away his strength, the sunlight dazzled him, and
      feeling a little overcome, and not equal, without pause, to the long
      interview that awaited him, he stayed awhile in a shady laurel corner, and
      leaning against a piece of iron railing, watched Mr. Brookes and Mr.
      Berkins as they paced the tennis lawn to and fro. The old gentleman
      frequently stopped in his walk to point at the glass houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Berkins, I wish you would try to get Willy some appointment; he
      would, I am sure, take anything over two hundred and fifty a year. He
      would do marvellously well in an office&mdash;he loves it. I assure you
      his eyes twinkle when one speaks of how books are kept, or alludes in any
      way to the routine of office work. You should see his accounts and his
      letter books, they would make the best clerk you ever had feel ashamed of
      himself; but left to himself I am afraid he will do no good; he has all
      the method, but nothing else. He lost money in Bond Street; I am afraid to
      tell you how much he dropped on the Stock Exchange, but that was not
      entirely his fault&mdash;the firm went bankrupt; nobody could have
      foreseen it, it was quite unheard of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have always noticed that successful men do not buy partnerships in
      firms that go bankrupt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very true, Berkins; I wish I had asked your advice on the subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you had, Mr. Brookes. You are no doubt a very clever man, but on
      one or two points you are liable to make mistakes; you are, if I may so
      speak, a little weak. You should come and live with me for a few months, I
      would put you right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is really too much,&rdquo; thought Mr. Brookes; and had it not been for
      the certain knowledge that Berkins had lately increased his income by a
      couple of thousands a year, he would have answered him tartly enough; but
      as this fact admitted of no doubt he bridled his anger and said: &ldquo;If you
      could put my boy right it would be more to the point. He has all the
      method of the best clerk in London; he loves the work, he would do honour
      to any office, but on his own hook I am afraid he will never do anything
      but lose his money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your money, you mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my money if you like. You are very provoking, Berkins. I don't know
      if you do it with the express purpose of annoying me. I was saying, when
      you interrupted me, that Nature had evidently intended my son for a clerk
      rather than for a speculator. I fear he is doing very badly with his shop
      in Brighton. The rents are very high in East Street, and I don't think he
      sells anything. He takes enough away from here, though. I don't remember
      if I ever told you that I was foolish enough to agree to his taking away,
      buying from me at the market price he calls it, the surplus produce of my
      garden and greenhouses. I dare say I shall get the money one of these
      days, but at present I see no sign of it. He is always making up the
      accounts, and, so far as we have gone, the result of this arrangement is
      that, when I complain that there is neither fruit nor vegetables on my
      table, I am told that everything went to Brighton. I am forced, I assure
      you, to send my carriage and my horses, that I paid two hundred guineas
      for, to fetch potatoes, and he, too, uses my carriage to take his
      vegetables to the shop. He gets his sisters to bring them when they go out
      driving, nor can I even buy my fruit and vegetables off him at cost price;
      he says that would interfere with his book-keeping, and so I am obliged to
      buy everything from Hutton, and you know what his prices are. I assure
      you, it is most annoying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Brookes, your fortune will not bear this constant drain; you must
      remember that we are living in very bad times&mdash;times that are not
      what they were. I have heard that your distillery&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, times are very bad. I have never known them worse, and no doubt you
      find them so too. They ought to affect you even more than they do me. My
      income is, as you know, all invested money, whereas yours is all in your
      business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, I am affected by the times; had they remained what they were,
      even what they were towards the end of the seventies, I should be making
      now something over ten thousand pounds a year. But, thank God! I have not
      to complain. Next year I hope to invest another five thousand pounds. The
      worst of it is, that there is no price for money in legitimate
      securities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything is very bad; you never will invest your money as I did mine
      ten years ago. My business is not, of course, what it used to be, but I
      don't complain; if it weren't for troubles nearer home I should get on
      very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope that Sally has commenced no new flirtation in the Southdown Road.
      I thought she had promised you&mdash;since she gave up Meason&mdash;that
      she would for the future know no one that lived there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was thinking for the moment of Willy, not of Sally; she has not been so
      troublesome lately. But no sooner are we out of one trouble than we are in
      another. It is, of course, very regrettable that young Escott should have
      stabbed himself, and in my garden too. I, who hate scandals, seem always
      plunged in one. I hear they are talking of it in the clubs in Brighton. I
      hope Lord Mount Rorke will not hear of it; if he did, do you think it
      would prejudice him against the match?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you're prepared to give your consent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? Surely! I really don't see&mdash;Lord Mount Rorke is a very rich
      man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Possibly, but Irish peers are not always as rich as they would like us to
      believe they are. The connection is, of course, desirable, but I hope your
      anxiety to secure it will not lead you into making foolish, I will say
      reprehensible, monetary concessions. What I mean is this. I am a
      straightforward man, Mr. Brookes, brought up in a hard school, and I
      always come straight to the point. You are a rich man, Mr. Brookes&mdash;you
      have the reputation of being a richer man than you are&mdash;and it is
      possible, I don't say it is probable, that Lord Mount Rorke will expect
      you to make a large settlement. He will possibly&mdash;mind you, I do not
      say probably&mdash;taking the coronet into consideration&mdash;those
      people think as much of their titles as we do of our money&mdash;ask you
      to settle a thousand a year, may be fifteen hundred a year, upon your
      daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Settle a thousand&mdash;maybe fifteen hundred&mdash;a year on my
      daughter!&rdquo; cried the horror-stricken Brookes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He may even ask for two thousand a year. Remember, you are a distiller&mdash;he
      is a peer of the realm. And now I say,&rdquo; continued Berkins, growing more
      emphatic as he reached the close of his declamation, &ldquo;that in my wife's
      interest I will oppose any and all attempts to purchase a coronet for
      Maggie at her sister's expense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Brookes stood for a moment stupefied&mdash;as if some great calamity
      had befallen him. The housekeeping bills, the loss of his fruit and
      vegetables, even the Southdown Road seemed as nothing in the face of this
      new misfortune. Troublesome as his daughters were, he preferred an
      occasional recrudescence of flirtation in his garden to settling the money
      that he had made himself and letting them go; no pen can describe the
      anguish that the surrendering of the ten thousand pounds which he had
      settled on Grace had caused him; but to be told now that the alliance with
      a lord which he so greedily coveted, and which had been so agreeably
      tickling him for the last few days, would cost him perhaps two thousand a
      year, was more than he could bear. He had avoided as much as possible even
      thinking of the money question. One hundred&mdash;two hundred&mdash;the
      shadow of three hundred had fallen for a moment on his mind, but he had
      successfully chastened these unpleasantnesses by thoughts of the
      liberality, the generosity of the aristocracy, and he had encouraged a
      hope that Mount Rorke would let him off with a statement of how much
      Maggie would have at his death. And now to hear these terrible
      prognostications, and from his own son-in-law, too. It was too bad&mdash;it
      was too cruel. &ldquo;You don't know what you are talking about, Berkins. If it
      were business I would listen to you, but really when it comes to
      discussing the aristocracy it is more than I can stand. What do you know
      about the aristocracy&mdash;not that,&rdquo; cried Mr. Brookes, snapping his
      fingers. &ldquo;You were brought up in an office&mdash;what should you know? You
      were a clerk once at thirty shillings a week&mdash;what should you know?
      Lord Mount Rorke would never think of making such ridiculous proposals to
      me. You judge him by yourself, Berkins, that's it, that's it! I dare say
      he has heard of me in the City&mdash;many of your great lords do business
      in the City. I dare say he has heard of me, and if he has he'll not try
      any nonsense with me. Twist him round my finger, twist him round my
      finger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Berkins liked a lord, but Berkins liked lords without thinking himself one
      jot their inferior, and he was sure that his horse and his dog and his
      house and everything belonging to him were better than theirs; and secure
      in the fact that his grandfather had been a field officer, he did not
      think it amiss to brag that he had begun life with thirty shillings a
      week, so he only smiled at his father-in-law's wrath, feeling now easy in
      his mind that Grace's future fortune would not be prejudiced for Maggie's
      glorification.
    </p>
    <p>
      The discussion had fallen, and Mr. Brookes went to meet the young man whom
      he caught sight of coming across the sward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most imprudent of you to come out to-day,&rdquo; he said, scanning the white
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am very well now, thanks. The sun is a little overpowering, that is
      all. I want to speak to you, Mr. Brookes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak to me? Yes. Will you go into the billiard-room, my boy? I can see
      the heat has upset you. Take my arm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frank took the offered arm. He was feeling very faint, but the cool and
      dim colour of the billiard-room revived him, and when he had had some
      claret and water, he said that he felt quite strong, and listened
      patiently to Mr. Brookes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I never! No, I never heard of such a thing. A stiletto, too. You
      brought it from Italy? It makes me feel quite young again. Ah! 'tis hard
      to say what we won't do for a girl when Miss Right comes along. I was just
      the same&mdash;pretty keen on it, I can tell you, when I was your age; and
      I don't know, even now,&mdash;but a man with grown-up daughters must be
      careful. Still when I see a little waist, high heels, plump&mdash;you
      know, that's the way I used to like them when I used to go to the oyster
      shops; there was one at the top of the Haymarket. Ah! I was young then,
      young as you are; I was keen on it&mdash;Aunt Mary will tell you that&mdash;there
      was nothing I wouldn't do; I never went as far as stabbing&mdash;walking
      about at night, tears, torments as much as you like, but I never went so
      far as stabbing. Wonderful what love will make a man do! Supposing you had
      killed yourself; in my garden, too&mdash;awful! What would people say? I
      hear they are talking of it in the clubs&mdash;hope it won't go any
      further. Should Mount Rorke hear of it! Eh? Might set him against us;
      might not give his consent&mdash;eh? We should be up a tree, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think there is much danger of that. I came to-day, Mr. Brookes,
      to ask for your consent; am I to understand that you give it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear Frank, I don't see why I should refuse it; I have known you
      since you were quite a small boy. I don't want to flatter you. I don't
      know that I care much about young men as a rule, but you, I have always
      found you&mdash;well, just what you should be. Of course the connection is
      very flattering. You will one day be Lord Mount Rorke, and to see my
      darling Maggie sharing your honours will be&mdash;that is to say if I live
      to see it&mdash;a great, a very gre&mdash;great hon&mdash;our.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Feeling much embarrassed Frank begged of him not to mention it. &ldquo;I shall
      be writing to-morrow or next day to my uncle; shall I say that you have
      given your consent to my marriage with your daughter? I may say that I
      have already written to him on the subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By all means, my dear boy. I think I can say you have my consent&mdash;that
      is to say, you have my consent if the money's all right. All is, of
      course, subject to that. Now you are for love in a cottage, bread and
      cheese romance; a man who will use a stiletto can't be expected to know
      much about money, but I am a father, my stiletto days are over, and I
      couldn't give my daughter without a settlement. You will, no doubt, be&mdash;of
      course you will be&mdash;Lord Mount Rorke one of these days; but in the
      meantime there must be a proper settlement. My daughter must be properly
      provided for; it is my duty to look after her interests, so you may as
      well tell your uncle that I shall be pleased to meet him and talk the
      matter over with him. I will meet him in London, when it suits his
      convenience; I need hardly say that if he should choose to come down here
      that I shall be pleased to see him. And now tell me&mdash;of course he
      will be prepared to act handsomely; I have no doubt he will, the
      aristocracy always do act handsomely, no one is so liberal as your
      aristocrat. I hope he will settle a good round sum on my daughter&mdash;money
      invested in first-class securities, not what Berkins would call
      first-class, but what I should call first-class securities; and should
      your uncle prove the liberal man that I have no doubt he is, I don't say
      that I won't behave handsomely. Of course you know that my dear children
      will have all my money at my death. I shall never marry again, that is a
      settled thing; but in the meantime I will do something. When Grace was
      married I behaved very generously&mdash;too generously&mdash;a lot of
      money&mdash;mustn't do it again, times are not what they were. But at my
      death I shall make no difference, all three will share and share alike.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frank hoped when Brookes and Mount Rorke met, that the former would modify
      his demands, and what was still more important, his mode of expressing
      them. But why should Mr. Brookes appear to him in such a sudden glow of
      vulgarity? He had never thought of him as a refined and cultivated
      gentleman, but was unprepared for this latest manifestation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord Mount Rorke allows me a certain annual income, he will no doubt
      double this income upon my marriage; I daresay he would&mdash;since he has
      recognised me as his heir&mdash;make this income legally mine by deed, I
      could then settle a certain sum on Maggie, in case of my death; but then
      further settlements would be required when I succeed to the title and the
      property. I had thought&mdash;and indeed I think still&mdash;that if my
      uncle makes me a sufficient allowance, that we might avoid touching on
      this matter at all. Lord Mount Rorke is an irritable man, and I am sure
      that if you were to speak to him as you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh! pooh! Nonsense! nonsense! You don't suppose I am going to give my
      daughter to a man unless he can settle a sufficient sum of money upon her?
      Berkins wouldn't hear of it. He was only telling me just now&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don't think you understand me, Mr. Brookes. I do not propose that
      you should give me any money with your daughter. Let what you give her be
      settled upon her, and let it be tied up as strictly as the law can tie
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh! pooh! the man that marries my daughter must settle a sum of money
      at least equal to what I settle upon her; and it must be money invested in
      first-class security, otherwise I couldn't think of giving her one penny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry, Mr. Brookes, that you are so determined on this point. These
      matters generally arrange themselves if people incline to meet each other
      half way, and I am sure that my uncle will resent it if you insist on
      pounds, shillings, and pence as you propose doing. He is not accustomed to
      strict business&mdash;marriages in our family were never made on such
      principles; my happiness is bound up in Maggie. I hope you will consider
      what you are risking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would do more for you than any one else, Frank, but business is
      business, and the man who has my daughter must settle a sum of money
      equivalent to what I settle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid I have talked too much, I am not very strong, yet with your
      permission we will adjourn this discussion to another day&mdash;in the
      meantime I will write to my uncle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Brookes did not offer the assistance of his arm, and had he, Frank
      would certainly not have accepted it. Holding the door, the old man waited
      for his visitor to pass out. &ldquo;Southdown Road or the heir to a peerage: it
      is all the same, my money is what is wanted&mdash;the money I had made
      myself,&rdquo; thought Mr. Brookes. &ldquo;Dreadful old man, he would sell his
      daughter for a settlement of a few hundred pounds a year. I never knew he
      was so bad, my eyes are opened,&rdquo; thought Frank. Both were equally angry,
      and without secrecy or subterfuge they sought consolation in different
      parts of the garden. Mr. Brookes resumed his walk on the tennis ground
      with Berkins, and stopping frequently to point to his glass-houses, he
      described his misfortunes with profuse waves of his stick. Frank had found
      Maggie, and they now walked together in the shade and silence of the
      sycamores&mdash;he, vehement and despairing of the future; she, subtle and
      strangely confident that things would happen as she wished them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having once yielded and felt the pang of possession she was wholly his, in
      all ramifications of spirit and flesh, both in her brain and blood, and
      the utmost ends of her sense mingled with him. But to him, she was the
      symbol of the desire of which he was enamoured, the desire which held
      together his nature and gave it individuality&mdash;love of <i>the</i>
      young girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! my darling, if he should speak so to Mount Rorke, we should be parted
      for ever&mdash;no, that could never be&mdash;nothing in heaven or earth
      would induce me to give you up, be true to me and I will be true to you;
      but our happiness&mdash;no, not our happiness, that is in ourselves&mdash;but
      all our prospects in life will be wrecked if he will not give way. Should
      he and Mount Rorke meet&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they won't meet; have patience&mdash;I know how to manage father. He
      doesn't like to part with his money, and I can understand it, he made it
      all himself; but he will get used to the idea in time, leave him to me;
      put your trust in me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She extended her hand, he took it, pressed it to his lips; he took her in
      his arms and kissed her, and the leaves of the sycamores were filled with
      the sunset.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAR SIR,&mdash;I received a letter this morning from my nephew,
      apprising me of his engagement to your daughter. He has apparently
      obtained your consent, and he asks for mine, and he also asks from me not
      only an increase of income to meet the requirements of altered
      circumstances, but he tells me that you will expect me to settle some
      seven, eight, or ten thousand pounds upon your daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not propose to discuss the reasonableness of his or your demands,
      but it seems that a statement of his prospects is owing to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Having never married when I was a young man, many have assumed&mdash;I
      among the number&mdash;that I never would marry; and I admit that I have
      allowed my nephew to grow up in the belief that he is my heir and the
      successor to the title of Mount Rorke; but beyond a general assumption
      existing in my mind, his mind, and the minds of those who know us, there
      is no reason to suppose that I shall not marry, or that I shall leave him
      a single sixpence, and I willingly make use of this opportunity to say
      that I have no faintest intention of entering intoany engagement either
      verbal or written with him upon this matter.&mdash;Yours very truly, MOUNT
      RORKE.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MY DEAR FRANK,&mdash;The enclosed is a copy of the letter which I send by
      this post to Mr. Brookes. And I make no disguise of the fact that it was
      written with the full intention of rendering your marriage an
      impossibility. It will no doubt appear to you a harsh and cruel letter; it
      will no doubt grieve you, madden you&mdash;in your rage you may call me a
      brute. The epithet will be unjust; but knowing very well indeed what love
      is at twenty-five, I will forgive it. And now to the point. I know
      something about old Brookes, and I remember the lean boy you used to bring
      here, and judging from some slight traces that Eton had not succeeded in
      effacing, I think I can guess what the rest of the family is like; indeed,
      the old gentleman's preposterous demand that I should settle ten thousand
      pounds on his daughter throws a sufficient light on his character, and in
      some measure reveals what sort of manner of man he is. But let all this be
      waived. I admit that with some show of reason, you may say it is unjust,
      nay more, it is ridiculous, to pronounce judgment on people I have never
      seen, and it is cruelty worthy of a Roman Emperor to wreck the lifelong
      happiness of two young people for the sake of a prejudice that the trouble
      of a journey to Brighton will most certainly extinguish. I will not
      irritate you by assuring you that the world is full of desirable
      women-women that will appeal to you two years hence precisely as Miss
      Brookes appeals to you now. Were I to whisper that it is unwise to give up
      all women for one woman, you could not fail, in your present mood, to see
      in my philosophy only the nasty wisdom of a cynical old reprobate.
      Therefore I will not weary you with advice&mdash;what I have said must be
      considered not as advice, but rather as an expression of personal
      experience in the love passion, serving as illustration of the attitude of
      my mind towards you. I will limit myself to merely asking you&mdash;no,
      not to think again of Miss Brookes&mdash;that would be impossible, but to
      leave Southwick for London or Paris, the latter for preference. I will
      give you a letter of introduction to a charming lady (ah! were I thirty
      years younger). Put yourself in her hands, and I have no doubt in the
      world but that she will send you back cured in six months, as my bank-book
      will abundantly prove.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you cannot do this&mdash;if so drastic a remedy should be too
      repugnant to your present feelings, I would remember, were I in your
      place, that my uncle had never refused me anything; that I could draw upon
      him for what money I liked&mdash;that is to say, for all pleasures and
      satisfaction save one. I would remember that at his death I was to inherit
      ten thousand a year and a title; and I would weigh (first examining each
      weight carefully, to see if it were true weight) all these present and
      future advantages against the gratification of possessing a woman I loved
      when I was twenty-five for a period of time extending perhaps over half a
      century; I would think&mdash;at least I think and hope I should hesitate&mdash;before
      I refused to obey one of whose affection I was sure, and I feel certain it
      would go hard with me before I refused to gratify the whim&mdash;call it a
      whim if you like&mdash;of one who had often given but never asked before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somehow I think you owe me this sacrifice; I have done much for you and
      am prepared to do more, and to speak quite candidly, I want something in
      return; I do not mean that I am desirous of striking a bargain with you,
      but we all expect to receive&mdash;of course not directly, but in some
      remote way&mdash;something for what we give, and I confess that I look
      forward to your companionship to assist me through the last course of
      life. I do not want you now&mdash;for the next few years I want you to see
      the world, to educate yourself; I want you to improve your taste in art
      and letters, and later on, if possible, to turn yourself to some public
      account. Besides other work, I am now working at my memoirs; they are to
      be published after my death, as I have arranged, under your supervision. I
      regard these memoirs as being of the first importance, and it is advisable
      that you should be in full possession of all my intentions respecting
      them. Hitherto I have always looked after everything myself, but the time
      will come when I shall not be able to do this, and shall require you to
      relieve me of the burden of business. Then I wish you to live here, so
      that you may learn to love Mount Rorke. I am very busy now with
      improvements, and I would wish you to be with me so that you might
      adequately enter into my views and ideas. To conclude, I do not marry for
      your sake; do you not marry for mine, at least do not marry for the
      present. I do not say that if I knew and liked the girl of your choice&mdash;if
      she were in your own set&mdash;that I could not be won over, but on the
      whole I would sooner you didn't marry. But I could not really endure a lot
      of new acquaintances&mdash;people who had never dined in a lord's house,
      and would all want to be asked&mdash;no, I could not endure it. I am an
      old man, and now I want to enjoy myself in my own way, and my desire is to
      get through the last years of my life with you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can do what you please, ask here whomever you please, give me a few
      hours of your time when I am particularly busy with my memoirs, and, above
      all, let us be alone sometimes after dinner, so that we can turn our
      chairs round to the fire and talk at our ease.&mdash;Your affectionate
      uncle, MOUNT RORKE.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he won't pay for a secretary, and wants me to do the work; that's
      about the meaning of that letter.&rdquo; Frank re-read the letter sentence for
      sentence, and as he read new sneers and new expressions of scorn rose in
      his brain in tremulous ebullition. There was scarcely a plan for the
      chastisement of his uncle that he did not for some fleeting moment
      entertain, and one most ironical letter he committed to paper; but Maggie
      would not hear of its being sent, and he was surprised and glad to see
      that she was not depressed and disheartened at the turn affairs had taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can do what I like with father; Sally can't, but I can. You leave it
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the good of that? You can't get round Mount Rorke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind; we don't want to get married yet awhile. We'll be engaged, it
      is nearly the same thing. We shall be able to go anywhere together&mdash;up
      to town, if we only come back the same day. Write a nice letter to your
      uncle, saying you'll do nothing without his consent; that it is true your
      affections are very much engaged, but that your first thought is of him&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! but my darling, I want to make you mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you shall&mdash;we shall be engaged; father won't consent to our being
      married, but he can't prevent us being engaged. You'll see, I'll get round
      father sooner or later; he'll give in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you won't get round Mount Rorke; if he would only come here and see
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He won't do that; but one of these days he'll be in London. I suppose he
      goes to the Park sometimes; we'll go too, you'll introduce me&mdash;a
      little impromptu, and I'll see if I can't get him to like me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How clever you are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still it required all Maggie's adroitness to even partially reconcile Mr.
      Brookes to Lord Mount Rorke's letter. She accepted without argument that
      marriage in the present circumstances was out of the question. She even
      went so far as to cordially assent that a man would be a fool to give his
      daughter to a man who could not settle a substantial sum of money upon
      her, and she only ventured to suggest that it would be foolish not to give
      Lord Mount Rorke the opportunity of changing his mind. She spoke of his
      immense fortune, and exaggerated it until she made even Berkins seem a
      paltry creature in the old man's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank was anxious to propitiate Sally. He returned from London with
      presents for her, and he always spoke to her, looking at her admiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He showed much anxiety, and, fearing that she found it dull at his studio,
      when the sisters came to tea he begged her to give him Meason's address.
      Sally tossed her head; she had had enough of Meason, and her manner left
      no doubt as to her sincerity. But happening to meet Meason a few days
      after in the train, Frank slipped easily into asking him to come and see
      him; and in the easy atmosphere of the studio the acquaintanceship soon
      ripened into intimacy, and after a preliminary ruffling of plumage, Sally
      restored her old sweetheart to all the rights of wrong. Life went well
      amid incessant secrets, letter-writing, and tea parties. Grace came to the
      studio to lunch sometimes, and she had been betrayed into a promise not to
      say a word about Meason. It was never ascertained whether, in the
      indiscretion of the marital night, she had betrayed this trust, or whether
      some jealous enemy had spoken or written to Mr. Brookes on the subject;
      but certain it is that one joyful day when Meason, Sally, and Maggie were
      eating oysters, and Frank was twisting the corkscrew into a bottle of
      Chablis, there came an ominous ringing at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder who that can be. Shut up, Triss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it is father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is in London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not so sure about that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter&mdash;we don't want to see them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather not! They wouldn't have known we were here had it not been for
      that dog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go and see who it is. Come here, sir; come here, you brute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Supposing it is father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get behind that piece of tapestry. I'll say that Meason and I were having
      some oysters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come here, sir. I'd better tie up that dog&mdash;I wonder who it is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Open the door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Mr. Brookes, quite an unexpected pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come, sir, for my daughters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your daughters? Your daughters are not here. Mr. Brookes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have reason to know they are here, and I will not leave without them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will do well to let us in, Mr. Escott; we are determined&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you? What business is it of yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Should you refuse us admission we are resolved to wait here till evening,
      till midnight if necessary!&rdquo; exclaimed Berkins. &ldquo;I say again you will do
      well to admit us, and so avoid a scandal on the green.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can come in if you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you kindly chain up that dog of yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, this is coming it too strong; this is a little too 'steep.' If Mr.
      Brookes refuses to believe my word that his daughters are not here he may
      come in and look for them, and to facilitate his search I will tie up the
      dog&mdash;(the dog is tied up). But you, what brings you here? What the
      devil, I should like to know, brings you here, poking your nose into other
      people's business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Brookes, will you answer him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must decline your offer to admit me unaccompanied by my son-in-law. We
      shall not stay long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All this seems to me very extraordinary, but since you wish it, Mr.
      Brookes, pray enter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that dog tied up quite securely?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite. I think you know Mr. Meason?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Meason knows very well that I do not wish to know him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you only come here to insult my guest, the sooner you go out the
      better. Had I known that you intended to behave in this fashion I should
      have left you standing outside till morning. I'll not have&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, Escott; I'm off. Mr. Brookes and I are no longer on speaking
      terms, that's all! I'll see you later on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't go, pray.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I must.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am surprised, Frank,&rdquo; said Mr. Brookes, when Meason was gone, &ldquo;that you
      should seek your friends among the enemies of my family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will not discuss that question now. I never heard of such conduct&mdash;you
      force your way into my studio, and apparently for no purpose but to insult
      my guest. You see your daughters are not here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am by no means satisfied with that,&rdquo; said Berkins, opening a door. &ldquo;I
      must see behind that piece of tapestry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you shall not. I have had just about enough of this. How dare you?
      God's truth&mdash;&rdquo; and as Berkins seemed determined to continue his
      search, Frank caught him by the collar.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Berkins was tall and strong, and showed no intention of allowing
      himself to be thrown out. His long legs were soon extended here and there;
      his body was sometimes bent back by Frank's weight, once he had succeeded
      in nearly throwing Frank over on the sofa. Mr. Brookes had fled to the
      door, which, in his excitement, he failed to open, and the struggle was
      continued until at last, maddened by a most tight and tempting aspect of
      Berkin's thigh, Triss broke his collar, and in a couple of bounds, reached
      and fixed his teeth deep in the flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Triss, you brute, leave go.&rdquo; But Triss clung to the long-desired thigh.
      &ldquo;I'll twist his tail, it will make him leave go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a savage yelp of pain the dog turned on his master and was hauled
      instantly off Berkins's thigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I need hardly say that so far as the dog is concerned, I regret, and I am
      truly sorry for what has occurred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, do you not see what a state I am in; do not stand there making
      excuses, but lend me your handkerchief. I shall bleed to death if you
      don't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I tie it up for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If those girls there would only fetch a doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Brookes could not refrain from foolish laughter, and in a moment of
      wretched despair he declared that it would be all the same in a hundred
      years time&mdash;a remark which would not have failed to irritate Berkins
      if he had not fainted.

    <p>
      Next day Willy called at the studio, and Frank told him what had occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don't see why you shouldn't come to the Manor House,&rdquo; said Willy.
      &ldquo;If you will only say something about the Measons, I think it can be made
      all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I'm not going to turn against Meason; I have always found him a good
      fellow. I know nothing about his flirtation with Sally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more do I; I think it has been exaggerated, but, as you know, I never
      interfere. I wish you would come in to dinner one night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Supposing I were to meet Berkins?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Willy stroked his moustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it is quite impossible that I could return to the Manor House. Your
      father behaved in a way&mdash;well, I will not say what I think of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Berkins hasn't been to the City since. Grace was over here yesterday, she
      says he limps about the garden. He'll never forgive you; he says that you
      didn't call the dog off at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a lie; and I said, 'So far as the incident with the dog is
      concerned, I am very sorry.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that made him more angry than anything else; he thought you were
      laughing at him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was not. It was most unfortunate. I shall not give Maggie up. I am
      writing to-morrow or next day to Mount Rorke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All were agreed that things must come right sooner or later. Maggie fought
      for her lover, and emphatically asserted her engagement. She yielded on
      one point only&mdash;not to visit the studio; but she maintained her right
      in theory and in practice to go where she liked with him in train or in
      cart, to walk with him on the cliff, to lunch with him at Mutton's. They
      found pleasure in thus affirming their love, and it pleased them to see
      they were observed, and to hear that they were spoken about. Nevertheless
      the string that sung their happiness had slipped a little, and the note
      was now not quite so clear or true. Frank could not go to the Manor House;
      Maggie could not go to the studio. Whether Mount Rorke would consent to
      their marriage perplexed them as it had not done before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The summer fades, the hills grow grey, and a salt wind blew up from the
      sea, blackening the trees, and the beauty of autumn was done. Frank
      thought of Ireland, and what personal intercession might achieve. She
      begged of him to go, and he promised to write to her every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every day, darling, or I shall be miserable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrived safe after a very rough passage. Every one was ill, I most of
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She received a post-card:&mdash;&ldquo;It was raining cats and dogs when I got
      out of the train. Mount Rorke sent a car to meet me; the result is that I
      am in bed with a bad cold. The house is full of company&mdash;people I
      have known, or known of, since I was a boy; we shall begin
      pheasant-shooting in a few days. When I am out of bed I shall write a long
      letter. Do you write to me; I shall be awfully disappointed if I do not
      get a letter to-morrow morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Extract from a letter:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mount Rorke is considered to be a handsome place, but as I have known it
      from childhood, as my earliest memories are of it, I cannot see it with
      the eyes of a professed scenery hunter. I have loved it always, but I do
      not think I ever loved it more than now, for now I think that one day I
      shall give it to you. Should that day come&mdash;and it will come&mdash;what
      happiness it will be to walk with you under the old trees, made lovelier
      by your presence, to pass down the glades to the river, watching your
      shadow on the grass and your image in the stream. We will roam together
      through the old castle, and I will show you the little bed I used to sleep
      in, the school-room where I learned my lessons. When I entered the old
      room I saw in imagination&mdash;and oh, how clearly!&mdash;the face of my
      governess; and how easily I see her in the corridor she used to walk down
      to get to her room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor, dear, old thing, I wonder what has become of her!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw again the pictures that stirred my childish fancy, and whose
      meaning I once vainly strove to decipher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came to live here when I was four, immediately after my father's death.
      I can just remember coming here. I remember Mount Rorke taking me up in
      his arms and kissing me. I will not say there is no place like home&mdash;I
      do not believe that; but certainly no place seems so real. Every spot of
      ground has its own particular recollections. Every bend of the avenue
      evokes some incident of childish life (in Ireland we call any road leading
      to a house an avenue, even if it is absolutely bare of trees; we also
      speak of rooks as crows, and these two provincialisms jarred on my ear
      after my long stay in Sussex). Mount Rorke is covered with trees&mdash;great
      woods of beech and fir&mdash;and at the end of every vista you see a piece
      of blue mountain. A river passes behind the castle, winding through the
      park; there are bridges, and swans float about the sedges, and there are
      deer in the glades. The garden,&mdash;I do not know if you would like the
      garden; it is old-fashioned&mdash;full of old-fashioned flowers&mdash;convolvuluses,
      Michaelmas daisies, marigolds; hedges clipped into all sorts of strange
      and close shapes. There is a beautiful avenue behind the garden (an avenue
      in the English sense of the word) where you may pace to and fro and feel
      an exquisite sense of solitude; for when the castle had passed out of the
      hands of Irish princes&mdash;that is to say, brigands&mdash;it was turned
      into a monastery, and I often think, as I look on the mossy trees&mdash;the
      progeny of those under whose leafage the monks told their beads&mdash;that
      all happened that I might throw my arm about you some beautiful day, and
      whisper, 'My wife, this is yours.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How beautifully he writes,&rdquo; said Sally reflectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never had a lover who wrote to you like that. Do you remember how
      Jimmy used to write?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know how he wrote to you, but his letters to me, I will say that,
      were quite as nice as anything Frank could write. You needn't toss your
      head, you are not Lady Mount Rorke yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sally refused to hear, but presently, seeing a cloud on her sister's face,
      and thinking the letter contained some piece of unpleasantness, she
      relented, and pressed her to continue.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;The house is full of people&mdash;people whom I have known all my life&mdash;and
they make a great deal of me. I have to tell them about Italy, and they
ask me absurd questions about Michael Angelo or Titian, Leonardo or
Watteau.... The house party is a large one, and we have people to dinner
every day; and in the evening the drawing-room, with its grim oak and
escutcheons and rich modern furniture, is a pretty sight indeed. There
is a lady here whom I knew in London, Lady Seveley; and I have had
suspicions that Mount Rorke would like me to marry her. But she has
the reputation of being rather fast, so perhaps the old gentleman is
allowing his thoughts to wander where they should not. I hope not for
his sake, for I hear she is devoted to a young Irishman, a Mr. Fletcher,
a journalist in London. I met them at Reading once in most suspicious
circumstances. He is the son of a large grazier, one of my uncle's
tenants, and she is, I suppose, so infatuated that she could not resist
the temptation of calling on his family. She was careful not to speak
of her intentions to anybody, but waited until she got a favourable
opportunity and slipped off to pay her visit. The Fletchers live about
half a mile from the castle. I was riding that way, and met her coming
out of their house. I got off my horse and walked back together. I hope
Mount Rorke will not hear of her ladyship's escapade; he would be very
angry, for the Fletchers are people who would be asked to have something
to eat in the housekeeper's room if they called at the Castle. In London
one knows everybody, but in the country we are more conservative.&rdquo;

 &ldquo;I hope she won't cut you out,&rdquo; said Sally. &ldquo;It would be a sell for
you if she did. Go on.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I shan't, you are too insulting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who began it? You told me that I didn't get such nice letters as you.
      Pray go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know if you would think her handsome. I don't. She is, however,
      an excellent musician; we play duets together every evening, to Mount
      Rorke's intense delight. You know my dialogue between a lady and a
      gentleman? She has written it down for me and corrected a few mistakes; I
      think I shall publish it. Darling, I love you better than any one in the
      world; you are all the world to me; try to love me a little&mdash;you will
      never find any one to love you as I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you can't find anything peculiarly disagreeable to say about that,
      I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Extract from another letter:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the visitors have gone; Mount Rorke and I are quite alone. He is
      kindness itself, and does not bother me about his memoirs; but from what I
      hear that book will make one of the biggest sensations ever made in the
      literary world. I want him to publish it now, but he only smiles and
      shakes his head. He says: 'What is the use of setting the world talking
      about you when you are alive; as long as I am alive I can see those I want
      to see, and be with them far more personally than I could by placing in
      their hands three volumes in 8vo; the 8vos are only useful when you have
      passed into darkness, and are not yet reconciled to dying quite out of the
      minds of men. I do not desire to be remembered by those who will live
      three hundred years hence, but I confess that I should like to modulate
      the pace of forgetfulness according to my fancy, and be remembered, let us
      say, for the next sixty or seventy years. I find no fault with death but
      its abruptness, and that I hope to be able to correct. The vulgar and most
      usual plan is children, but children are no anodyne to oblivion, whereas a
      good book in a certain measure is.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These are almost the words Mount Rorke used, and I quote them as exactly
      as possible, so that you may see what kind of man he is. We pulled our
      chairs round to the fire and had a real good talk. I know no better
      company than Mount Rorke. He has seen everything, read everything, and
      known everybody worth knowing; he is a mine of information, and, what is
      far better, he is a complete man of the world; and long contact with the
      world has left him a little cynical, otherwise he is perfect. I told him
      the story about Berkins, and he laughed; I never saw him laugh so before;
      and when I told him that I had told Berkins, as he was tying up his leg,
      that so far as the incident with the dog was concerned, I regretted deeply
      what had occurred, he could not contain himself. He rang the bell, and we
      had old Triss up. He asked a great deal about you; I leave you to imagine
      what I said. How did he expect me to describe my darling? I told him of
      your subtle, fascinating ways, of your picturesque attitudes, and your
      exquisite little black eyes. 'I think I see her,' he said; 'little eyes
      that light up are infinitely more interesting than those big, limpid,
      silly eyes that everybody admires.' I am now doing a water-colour sketch
      from the photograph&mdash;the one in which you stand with your hands
      behind your back and your head on one side&mdash;for him. I am getting on
      with it pretty well. Ah! if only I had you here for an hour (I should like
      to have you here for ever, of course; but now I am speaking artistically,
      not humanly), I think I could get it really like you; there are one or two
      things that the photo does not give me. I shall send the sketch to Dublin
      to be framed; it will be a nice present for Mount Rorke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My darling, you must not be anxious; all will come right in time&mdash;have
      a little patience. He is already much more reconciled to the match than he
      was when I arrived, and if your father will refrain from speaking too much
      about that hateful question, I am sure that all difficulties can be
      surmounted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She wrote to him three or four times a week, and on beautiful hand-made
      paper, delicately scented.
    </p>
    <p>
      Extract from a letter:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We went up to town yesterday by the ten o'clock train West Brighton; and
      so that we might have more money to spend, we went third class. Father
      doesn't like us going third class, but I don't think it matters if you get
      in with nice people. We were very jolly. The Shaws went with us. They are
      very nice girls. They had to leave us at Victoria, and I and my cousin,
      Agnes Keating, went shopping together. We met the Harrisons at Russell
      &amp; Allen's. We saw there some lovely dresses&mdash;I wish you had been
      with us, for I have confidence in your taste, and when I choose a thing
      myself I am never sure that I like it. The assistant was so polite; she
      told me to ask for Miss &mdash;&mdash;; she said she would like to fit me.
      Sally was coming up with us, but she changed her mind and remained at
      home, I was very glad, for she is wretchedly cross, and not looking at all
      well. You would not admire her in the least; she is growing very yellow.
      But I don't mean to be ill-natured, so we'll let Sally bide, as we say in
      Sussex. After Russell &amp; Allen's we went to Blanchard's, and had a nice
      lunch. Grace was in town; she chaperoned us, and paid for everything; it
      was very kind of her. Then we went to the theatre, and saw a play which we
      did not care about much. There was a very stupid 'tart' in it. I do like
      'gadding,' don't I? But, oh, my darling Frank, gadding is not really
      gadding without you. How I miss you, how we all miss you, but I
      especially. The Keatings came over to tea to-day, and they asked about
      you. Blanche wants you to write something in her album, and she admired
      immensely the drawing you gave me. She is very artistic in her tastes; I
      think you would like her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have a bit of news that I think will amuse you. You remember Mrs.
      Horlock's old dog&mdash;not the blind Angel; he's old too. But I mean the
      real old dog,&mdash;the one twenty years old, that once belonged to a
      butcher. He never smelt very sweet, as you know, but latterly he was
      unbearable, and the General resolved on a silent and secret destruction.
      He purchased in Brighton a bottle of chloroform. It was the dead of the
      night and pitch dark. However, he reached the end of the passage in
      safety; but suddenly he uttered a fearful shriek and dropped the
      chloroform. He thought he had seen a ghost; but it was only Mrs. Horlock,
      who was going her rounds, letting down the mouse-traps and supplying the
      little creatures with food. The General blurted out various excuses. He
      said that he had come to relieve the cock parrot's tooth-ache&mdash;that
      he feared the Circassian goat was suffering from spinal complaint and the
      squirrels from neuralgia. But his protestations proved unavailing, and now
      he eats his meals in silence. And to make matters worse, the old dog did
      die a few days after&mdash;the General says from old age, but Mrs. Horlock
      avows that his death resulted from fright. 'He was a sweet, cunning old
      thing, and no doubt knew all about that plan to destroy him.' I think this
      would make an excellent subject for a comic sketch; I wish you would do
      one&mdash;the General dropping the bottle; Mrs. Horlock, surrounded by
      closed mouse-traps and crumbs, sternly upbraiding him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see lots of Emily Pierce. Every Sunday I have tea with her, and
      sometimes lunch; but she doesn't come here. I am afraid I couldn't get on
      at all without her; we do everything together, and we hit it off so well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sally has been staying in Kent. I do not know what's up, but she seems to
      see everything <i>couleur de rose</i>; everything in Kent is better in her
      estimation than anywhere else. The men dance so much better for one thing.
      I am glad she is so happy, and I wish she would get married and stay
      there. Father says he has a cough that tears him to pieces, but I haven't
      heard it yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The elementary notion of a woman in love is to surround, to envelop the
      man she loves, with her individuality, and to draw him from all other
      influences. And the woman in love strives to accomplish this by ceaseless
      reiteration of herself or himself seen through herself. So Maggie with her
      nervous, highly-strung, febrile temperament could not refrain from
      constantly striking the lyre of love. Her hands were for ever on the
      chords. Letters and notes of all kinds; impetuous messages asking him when
      he would return; letters apologising for her selfishness&mdash;he had
      better remain with Mount Rorke until his consent had been obtained;
      resolutions and irresolutions, ardours, lassitudes, forgetfulness followed
      fast in strange and incomprehensible contradiction. And Frank was asked
      daily to perform some small task. There was always something; and Frank
      undertook all he was asked to do, for he loved to be as much as possible
      in that circle of life in which his sweetheart lived, and to feel her
      presence about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Extract from a letter:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mount Rorke and I had a long and serious talk about you last night. He is
      against the marriage, but then he is against marriage in general. He said
      with his quiet, cynical laugh, 'I daresay she is a pretty girl&mdash;I can
      read the truth through your romantic descriptions. I am convinced that she
      is very charming. But are you quite sure that you will never meet another
      equally charming girl? Remember the world is a very big place, and the
      stock of women is large; are you sure that you will be able to enjoy the
      charm which now rules and enchants you for thirty, forty years without
      wearying of it? These are the questions you have to consider, which
      marriage entails.' I need hardly tell you what answer I made, and how I
      tried to convince him that your charms are those that a man capable of
      appreciating them could not weary of. Indeed I think I made him rather a
      neat answer&mdash;I said there are books in one volume, in two volumes, in
      three volumes, and there are books that you can take down and read at any
      time. He laughed; it rather tickled his fancy. And he said, 'Quite true,
      there are some books and some women that one never tires of&mdash;that is
      to say, that some people never tire of. I haven't been so fortunate or
      unfortunate, but that by the way. I admit such cases may occur. I will go
      further&mdash;I will admit that a man's life may be made or marred by his
      taking to himself a wife; and if Miss Brookes were a really nice girl&mdash;if
      she were the one girl in a million, and if I were sure that your passion
      for each other has its root in deeper and more lasting sympathies than
      those of the skin (these were his exact words)&mdash;believe me, my dear
      Frank, I should not think of opposing the marriage. I shall be in London
      during the season, and no doubt an occasion will arise, of which I promise
      you to avail myself, of making this model young lady's acquaintance. I
      will tell you what I think of her; she won't deceive me, let her try how
      she will. There is only one thing I bar&mdash;one thing must not be, one
      thing I will not tolerate&mdash;a bad marriage.' I lost my temper for a
      moment, but Mount Rorke did not lose his, and I soon came round. It is
      annoying to be spoken to in that way; but I remembered that he had not
      seen you, and I consoled myself by thinking of how great his conversion
      will be when he does. My only fear is that he'll want to marry you
      himself. So, you see, my own darling, my uncle is on the 'give,' and we
      shall win soon and easily. The only real obstacle is your father's
      pig-headedness on all matters in which money enters. I think with terror
      of his meeting with Mount Rorke. If he speaks to Mount Rorke as he spoke
      to me, my uncle will take up his hat and wish him good-morning. Do you
      exert all your influence. Do leave no stone unturned. All depends upon
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Extract from another letter:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am weary of this place, and I long to see you. My longing is such that
      I can resist it no longer. Besides, nothing would be gained by remaining
      here. Mount Rorke will not say more than he has said. In a few days&mdash;think
      of that&mdash;I shall be with you. With what eagerness I look forward. How
      gladly I shall see the train leave the dreary bogs and the blue mountains
      of the West and pass into the pasture lands of Meath; how gladly I shall
      hail the brown, slobber-faced city of Dublin; with what delight I shall
      step on board the packet&mdash;I shall not think of sea sickness&mdash;and
      watch the line of the low coast disappear, then the Welsh mountains and
      castles, looking so like an illustrated history of England. I must spend
      two days in London, alas! I must order some new clothes. Victoria Station,
      with all its doors and cab stands, and book-stalls, the Sussex scenery,
      the woodlands, the Downs, the plunging through tunnels, and then you.
      Darling, I cannot believe that such happiness is in store for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All happened as he had anticipated. At Victoria the usual difficulties had
      arisen about the dog. Triss was growling, the guard was cringing, and,
      with reference to no stoppage before we come to Redhill, the necessity of
      a muzzle was being argued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am certain it is she,&rdquo; and he followed with his eyes the tall, swinging
      figure in the black cloth dress. Then he saw the clear plump profile, so
      white, of Lizzie Baker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, give me the chain, I'll tie the dog up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the muzzle, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A muzzle was procured, and Frank ran to the third class carriage where he
      had seen Lizzie enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lizzie! Lizzie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Escott, who would have thought of seeing you! It is such a time&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, isn't it; how long? But are you going to Brighton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So am I; but&mdash;let me get you a first-class ticket. Guard, have I
      time to change my ticket?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, the train is going to start; get in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you get out, Lizzie; I'll pay the difference at Brighton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No time for changing now, sir; are you getting into this carriage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He could not forego the pleasure of being with Lizzie. An old woman with a
      provision basket on her lap drew her skirts aside and made way for him;
      there were three dirtily dressed girls&mdash;probably shop girls; they sat
      whispering together, a little troubled by the publicity; there were two
      youths, shabbily dressed, their worn boots and trousers covered with
      London mud. He was surprised, and he did not for a moment understand or
      realise his company. Frank had never been in a third-class carriage
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid you won't be comfortable here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, I shall; I'd just as soon travel in one class as another&mdash;much
      sooner when it means being with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None of your nonsense; I see you haven't changed. Well, who'd have
      thought it? Just fancy meeting you, and after all this time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long is it? It must be nearly two years. I haven't seen you sincethat
      day we went up the river.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; where did I see you since?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the bar; I didn't leave the 'Gaiety' for several days after.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more you did; I remember now. But why did you leave without letting me
      know where you were going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't know I was leaving till the morning, and I left in the
      afternoon. A lot of us were changed suddenly. The firm couldn't get enough
      young ladies to do the work at the Exhibition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you didn't leave an address.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you didn't; I asked the manager, and he told me you had left no
      address. They didn't know where you had gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he say so? You mean Mr. Fairlie, I suppose&mdash;now I come to think
      of it, it is the rule of the firm not to give information about the young
      ladies. I am sorry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am, really. We had a very pleasant day up the river&mdash;Reading; you
      took me to Reading.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but you would never come again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn't I? I suppose I couldn't find time&mdash;I did enjoy myself. What
      a lovely day it was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and do you remember how like a beautiful smile the river lay? And do
      you remember the bulrushes? I rowed you in among the rushes; you wet the
      sleeve of your dress plunging your arm in. I remember it, that white plump
      arm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get along with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wanted to make a sketch of you leaning over the boatside with your
      lapful of water-lilies; I wish I had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you had, too; you wrote a little poem instead. It was very pretty,
      but I should have liked the picture better. You gave me the poem next day
      when you came in to lunch. You had lunch at the bar, and I was so cross
      with you because you said I hadn't wiped the glass. It was all done to
      annoy me because I had been talking to that tall, rather stout young man,
      with the dark moustache, whom you were so jealous of. Don't you remember?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I remember; and I believe it was that fellow who prevented you from
      coming out with me again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it wasn't; but don't speak so loud, all these people are listening to
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frank met the round stare of the girls; and, turning from the dormant
      curiosity of the old woman, he said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember the locks, how frightened you were; you had never been
      through a lock before; and the beautiful old red brick house showing upon
      the lofty woods; and coming back in the calm of the evening, passing the
      different boats, the one where the girls lay back in the arms of the young
      men, the flapping sail, and the dreamy influences of the woods where we
      climbed and looked into space over the railing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the green-table&mdash;don't you remember?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I remember every hour of that day; we had lunch at the 'Roebuck.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven't spoken of the lady we saw there. Lady Something&mdash;I
      forget what you said her name was; you said she had been making up to
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dined with her one night, and we went to the theatre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may do that without it being said that you are making up to a
      gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course; I should never think of saying you made up to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should hope not, indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should never think of accusing you of having made up to me; you have
      always treated me very badly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lizzie did not answer. He looked at her, puzzled and perplexed, and he
      hoped that neither the girls nor the old lady had understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry; I really didn't mean to offend you. All I meant to say was
      that the lady we saw at the 'Roebuck' had been rather civil to me; had&mdash;well
      I don't know how to put it&mdash;shown an inclination to flirt with me&mdash;will
      that suit you?&mdash;and that I had not availed myself of my chances
      because I was in love with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Encouraged by a sunny smile, Frank continued: &ldquo;You wouldn't listen to me;
      you were very cruel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure I didn't mean to be cruel; I went out on the river with you,
      and we had a very pleasant day. You didn't say then I was cruel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you were very nice that day; it was the happiest day of my life. I
      was in love with you; I shall never care for any one as I cared for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't believe you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swear it is true. When you left the 'Gaiety' I searched London for you.
      If you had only cared for me we might have been very happy. As sure as a
      fellow loves a woman, so sure is she to like some other chap. Tell me, why
      did you go away and leave no address?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did leave an address.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we won't discuss that. Why didn't you write to me? You knew my
      address. It's no use saying you didn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I suppose I was in love with some one else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you? You always denied it. Ah! so you were in love with some one
      else? I knew it&mdash;I knew it was that thick-set fellow with the black
      moustache. I wonder how you could like him&mdash;the amount of whisky and
      water he used to drink.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, usen't he? I have served him with as many as six whiskies in an
      afternoon&mdash;Irish, he always drank Irish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could you like a man who drank?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it wasn't he&mdash;I assure you; I give you my word of honour. It
      really wasn't. I'd tell you if it was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, who was it, then? It couldn't be the old man with the beard and
      white teeth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it that great tall fellow, clean shaven?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it wasn't; you'll never guess; There's no use trying. However, it is
      all over now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? Did he treat you badly? Whose fault was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His. And the chances I threw away. He behaved like a beast. I had to give
      up keeping company with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don't know. He changed very much towards me lately; he went messing
      about after other girls, and we had words, and I left.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will make it up. Perhaps you are mistaken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mistaken&mdash;no; I found their letters in his pocket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are always rows between sweethearts; and then they kiss and make it
      up, and love each other the more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I shall not see him again. We were going to be married; no, it is all
      over. It was a little hard at first, but I am all right now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry. Do you think there is no chance of making it up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have thought that you would be glad; men are so selfish they
      never think of any one but themselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you mean? Why should I be glad that your marriage was broken off?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said just now that you liked me very much, I thought&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I do like you very much. Once I was in love with you&mdash;that day
      when we walked up the steep woods together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you don't care for me any longer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't say that; but I am engaged to be married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had you not snubbed me so I might have been married to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you going to be married to&mdash;to the lady we saw that day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, not to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't believe you. You mean to say you haven't been to see her since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean to say you haven't seen her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't say that. I've just come from Ireland. I've been staying with my
      uncle. She spent a week with us; that's all I have seen of her. I am going
      now to see the young lady whom I am engaged to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when will you be married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know; there are a great many difficulties in the way. Perhaps I
      shall never marry her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense. I know better. You think it will take me in. I'll never be
      taken in again, not if I know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want to take you in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know so much about that. Is she very pretty? I suppose you are
      very much in love with her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I love her very much. Dark, not like you a bit&mdash;just the
      opposite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you met her since you saw me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I thought as much, and yet you told me the day we went up the river
      together that you never had and couldn't care for any one elsebut me. Men
      are all alike&mdash;they never tell the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a minute; wait a minute. I knew her long before I knew you; I have
      known her since I was a boy, but that doesn't mean that I have been in
      love with her since I was a boy. I never thought of her until you threw me
      over, until long after; it was last summer I fell in love with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lizzie's eyes were full upon him, and it seemed to them that each could
      see and taste the essence of the other's thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you been doing ever since? You have told me nothing about
      yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, after trying vainly to find you&mdash;having searched, as I
      thought, all Speirs and Pond's establishments in London, I tried to resign
      myself to my fate. I assure you, I was dreadfully cut up&mdash;could do
      nothing. My life was a burden to me. You have been in love, and you know
      what an ache it is; it used to catch me about the heart. There was no
      hope; you were gone&mdash;gone as if the earth had swallowed you. I got
      sick of going to the 'Gaiety' and asking those girls if they knew anything
      about you; so to cure myself I went to France, and I worked hard at my
      painting. In such circumstances there is only one thing&mdash;work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; nothing does you any good but work. I worked in the <i>atelier</i>&mdash;that's
      the French for studio&mdash;all the morning, and in the afternoon I
      painted from the nude in a public studio. I had such a nice studio&mdash;such
      a jolly little place. I was up every morning at eight o'clock, my model
      arrived at nine, and I worked without stopping (barring the ten or twelve
      minutes' rest at the end of every hour) till twelve. Then I went to the
      cafe to have breakfast&mdash;how I used to enjoy those breakfasts&mdash;fried
      eggs all swimming in butter, a cutlet, after, nice bread and butter, then
      cock your legs up, drink your coffee, and smoke your cigarette till one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you like the French cafe better than the 'Gaiety'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is impossible to compare them. I made a great deal of progress. I
      began one picture of a woman in a hammock, a recollection of you. You
      remember when we passed under those cedar branches, close to the
      'Roebuck,' we saw a hammock hung by the water's edge, and I said I would
      like to see you in it, and stand by and rock you. I had intended to send
      it to the Academy, but I never could finish it, the French model was not
      what I wanted&mdash;I wanted you; and I was obliged to leave France, and I
      could get no one in Southwick. Once a fellow changes his model he is done
      for; he never can find his idea again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's Southwick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A village outside Brighton, three or four miles, not more. I have a
      studio there; you must come and see it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must paint me. But what would your lady love say if she found me in
      your studio? She'd have me out of it pretty quick. Tell me about her; I
      want to hear how you fell in love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It happened in the most curious, quite providential way. I have told you
      that I knew them since I was a boy. Maggie has often sat on my knee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maggie is her name, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, don't you like the name? I do. Her brother was a school-fellow of
      mine. We were at Eton together, and one time when Mount Rorke was away
      travelling they asked me to spend my holidays at Southwick. That's how I
      got to know them. One day Maggie and Sally were at my studio; Sally has a
      sweetheart&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sentence was cut short by a sudden roar. The train had entered a
      tunnel, and the speakers made pause, seeing each other vaguely in the dim
      light, and when they emerged into the cold April twilight Frank told the
      story of Triss and Berkins, Mr. Brookes struggling with the door, and the
      girls rushing screaming from their hiding-place; and Frank's imitation of
      Berkin's pomposity amused Lizzie, and she laughed till she cried. He
      continued till the joke was worn bare; then, fearing he had been talking
      too much of himself, he said: &ldquo;Now, I have been very candid with you, tell
      me about yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing to tell; I think I have told you all.&rdquo; Then she said,
      slipping, as she spoke, into minute confidences: &ldquo;When I left the 'Gaiety'
      I went for a few days to the Exhibition, but <i>he</i> wanted to leave
      London, so I applied to the firm to remove me to Liverpool (not Liverpool
      Street; the girl&mdash;I suppose it was Miss Clarke, for I wrote to her&mdash;made
      a mistake, or you misunderstood her). We remained in Liverpool a year, and
      then we came back to London, and I went to the 'Criterion,' but I couldn't
      stop there long; he was so awfully jealous of me; he used to catechise me
      every evening&mdash;who had I spoken to? How long I had spoken to this
      man? Once I slapped a man's face in fun because he squeezed my hand when I
      handed him the change across the counter. There was such a row about it. I
      don't know how <i>he</i> heard of it. I think he must have got some one to
      watch me. I often suspected the porter&mdash;the bigger one of the two;
      but you don't know the 'Criterion.' You used to go to the 'Gaiety.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps he saw you himself. I suppose he used to come to the bar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not unless&mdash;no, not very often. He banged me about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Banged you about, the brute! Good heavens! How could you like a man who
      would strike a woman? Who was he? Was he a gentleman&mdash;I mean, was he
      supposed to be a gentleman? Of course he wasn't really a gentleman, or he
      wouldn't have struck you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was in a passion, he was very sorry for it afterwards. Then I left the
      firm and went to live in lodgings; he allowed me so much a week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was a man of some means?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but it didn't cost him much, he knew the people. We were going to be
      married, but he got ill, and we thought we had better wait; and I went to
      the 'Gaiety' again. I was a fool, of course, to think so much about him,
      for I had plenty of chances. One man who used to lunch there three times a
      week wanted me to marry him, and take me right away. I think he was in the
      printing business&mdash;a man who was making good money; but I could not
      give Harry up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harry is his name, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but it all began over again. It was just the same at the 'Gaiety' as
      it was at the 'Criterion.' He would never leave me alone, but kept on
      accusing me of flirting with the gentlemen that came to the bar. Now, you
      know as well as I do what the bar is. You must be polite to the gentlemen
      you serve. There are certain gentlemen who always come to me, and don't
      care to be served by any one else, and if I didn't speak to them they
      wouldn't come to the bar. The manager is very sharp, and would be sure to
      mention it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom do you mean? That fellow with the yellow moustache that walks about
      with his frock-coat all open&mdash;a sort of apotheosis of sherry and
      bitters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what you called him once before. You see I remember. He is very
      fond of sherry and bitters. But I was saying that Harry would keep on
      interfering with me, pulling me over the coals. We had such dreadful rows.
      He accused me of having gone with gentlemen to their rooms&mdash;a thing I
      never did. I could stand it no longer, and we agreed to part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long is that ago?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About three weeks. I could stand it no longer, I couldn't remain at the
      'Gaiety,' so I resolved to leave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why couldn't you remain at the 'Gaiety,' the manager didn't know anything
      about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he knew nothing about it, it wouldn't have mattered if he had, but
      after a break up like that you can't remain among people you know&mdash;you
      want to get right away; there's nothing like a change. Besides I mightn't
      get such a good chance again; I had the offer of a very good place in
      Brighton, and I took it&mdash;a new restaurant, they open to-morrow. I get
      thirty pounds a year and my food.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And lodging?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, they are very short of accommodation, and I have taken a room in one
      of the streets close by&mdash;Preston Street. Do you know it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly, off the Western Road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lady who has the house knew my poor mother&mdash;a very nice woman&mdash;will
      let me have a bedroom for five shillings a week, and I shall be allowed to
      use her sitting-room when I want it, which, of course, won't be very
      often, for I shall be at business all day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The train rolled along the platform; Frank asked the porter when there
      would be a train for Southwick, and was told he would have half an hour to
      wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall have time to drive you to Preston Street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, please don't! She will be waiting for you&mdash;you will miss
      your train.&rdquo;

      XIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      About four in the afternoon he left off painting, and went to Brighton for
      a couple of hours. The little journey broke up the day, he bought the
      evening papers, and it was pleasant to glance from the news to those who
      passed, and to look upon the sunny and hazy sea. He liked to go to
      Mutton's, and regretted Lizzie was not there, instead of behind a bar
      serving whisky and beer. But he went to the bar. It was a German
      establishment, decorated with the mythological art of Munich, and
      enlivened with a discordant band. The different rooms were fitted with
      bars of various importance. Lizzie was engaged at the largest&mdash;that
      nearest the entrance. At half-past five this bar was thronged with all
      classes. Beer and whisky were drunk hurriedly, with a look of trains on
      the face. The quietest time was from half-past three to half-past four,
      during these hours the dining-room was alone in the presence of the awful
      goddesses and a couple of drowsy waiters. Most of the girls were out, some
      two or three read faded novels in the sloppy twilight; a group of four or
      five men who had lingered from half-hour to half-hour turned their backs,
      and talked among themselves; sometimes a couple would condescendingly
      address Lizzie, and tease her with rude remarks; or else Frank found her
      having a little private chat with an old gentleman, a youth, or, may be,
      the waiter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lizzie had her bar manners and her town manners, and she slipped on the
      former as she would an article of clothing when she lifted the slab and
      passed behind. They consisted principally of cordial smiles, personal
      observations, and a look of vacancy which she assumed when the
      conversation became coarse. From behind the bar she spoke authoritatively,
      she was secure, it was different&mdash;it was behind the bar; and she
      spoke with a cheek and a raciness that at other times were quite foreign
      to her. &ldquo;I will not sleep with you to-night if you don't behave yourself,&rdquo;
       so Frank once heard her answer a swaggering young man. She spoke out loud,
      evidently regarding her words merely in the light of gentle repartee. What
      she heard and said in the bar remained not a moment on her mind, she
      appeared to accept it all as part of the business of the place, and when
      Frank was annoyed she only laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Men will talk improper&mdash;what does it matter? One doesn't pay
      attention to their nonsense, and it is only in the bar. Never mind all
      that, tell me what you have been doing. You didn't come into Brighton
      yesterday, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I had to go to the Manor House.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how is she&mdash;the only one? Are you as much in love with her as
      ever?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I am; I have begun a portrait of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, another! You never finish anything. I shan't have that when I come
      and sit for you. I shall make you finish my portrait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes; when you come and sit. But, joking apart, when will you come? I
      should so like to show you my studio. It really looks very nice now. When
      will you come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not come next Sunday; it is your Sunday off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would Maggie say if she found me there? She'd have my eyes out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she did find it out she'd know you came to sit; but as a matter of
      fact she'd know nothing about it. You come and lunch with me about twelve&mdash;they're
      all in church about that time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you never go to church, you wicked boy. I don't know that I dare
      trust myself with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A scruple jarred the even strain of his desire to paint Lizzie's portrait,
      but his scruple vanished in one of her sweet sunny smiles, and he gave her
      all information about the train she would have to take to reach Southwick
      by twelve o'clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      He ordered some delicacies in the way of potted meats, and there was a
      bottle of champagne in a bucket of ice when she arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you keep your champagne in ice? We never do in the bar. When the
      gentlemen want it they have a piece to put in their wine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you'd try to forget your gentlemen when you come here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lizzie began to cry, and it was hard to console her; she said that Frank
      had spoilt her lunch for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is because you are so much superior to the men I see you speaking to.
      How can I help feeling annoyed that you should be serving drinks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I've got to get my living. You don't suppose I serve in a bar because
      I like it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, of course not; but don't let us talk any more about it. You're going
      to sit to me, and I want to do as pretty a portrait of you as I can. All
      that beautiful brown hair, and that hat! Let me take it from your head!&rdquo;
       Frank had bought this hat for her and had handed it to her over the
      counter, thereby bringing censure upon her from the manager. &ldquo;Let's forget
      what I said. The hat suits you. There, now against the light, just a
      three-quarter face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the end of half an hour he said she was a very good sitter and this
      pleased her, and she tried to keep the pose till the clock struck, but at
      the end of fifty minutes she said: &ldquo;I must get up,&rdquo; and she came round to
      see what he was doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you mustn't criticise it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It's only a beginning. You've
      forgiven me my remarks about the bar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't remind me of it again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he could not get it out of his head that he had annoyed her, and was
      unable to apply himself to his painting; perhaps for this reason his
      drawing went wrong, and his colour became muddy, and the thought struck
      him that if Maggie were to find this portrait about the studio she would
      certainly ask him whose portrait it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't paint to-day,&rdquo; he said, getting up from his easel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why can't you paint?&rdquo; The question seemed to him at first a stupid
      one, and then she showed a perception that surprised him. &ldquo;Are you afraid
      the young lady you're engaged to might come and catch me sitting to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fear that this might happen had been floating in the back of his mind
      for the last half hour; he had kept Lizzie too long in the studio, and it
      was not improbable that the girls might knock at his door at any moment,
      and if they did it would be impossible for him not to answer. Triss would
      bark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I won't keep you any longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I assure you,&rdquo; he said aloud, and within himself, &ldquo;I'd give a
      sovereign if I could get her to the station without being seen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he thought he had done so as he returned half an hour afterwards
      across the green. Maggie was waiting for him. &ldquo;Come to ask me to dine at
      the Manor House,&rdquo; he thought; but she told him that she knew all about his
      visitor, and, despite all Frank's efforts to pacify her she grew more
      violent, more excited until at last she told him she didn't want to see
      him any more, that he was to go away, that she gave him his liberty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an excitable girl she is! I'll go there this evening and try to coax
      her out of her anger. I must try to explain to her that a painter must
      have models. If we were married we shouldn't have more than a thousand a
      year to live on at the outside&mdash;that is to say, if Mount Rorke and
      Brookes come to terms, which is not very likely, they might make up a
      thousand a year between them, that would not be enough for two, and I
      should have to work; and I couldn't work without a model. The thing is
      absurd! She'll have to learn that a model is absolutely necessary; we were
      bound to have a row over that model question, so it might as well come off
      now as later on, and we shall understand each other better when this has
      blown over. There is nothing, and never has been anything, between me and
      Lizzie&mdash;my conscience is clear on that score. How pretty she looked
      to-day&mdash;that pale brown hair, so soft and so full of colour. To-day
      was an unlucky day; I began by being unfortunate with my painting; I never
      made a worse drawing in my life, and the worst of it was that I did not
      see that my drawing was wrong until I had begun to paint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A remembrance of Maggie's gracefulness came dazzling and straining his
      imagination, and in sharp revulsion of desire he assailed Lizzie with
      angry and contemptuous memory. She was always in low company&mdash;was
      never happy out of it; it was part of her. How this man liked six dashes
      of bitters in his sherry, and the other would not drink whisky except in a
      thin glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he was leaving the studio he received a letter from Maggie, and when he
      thought of the circumstances in which it was written, he grew genuinely
      alarmed, for there was no forgetting the seriousness of the letter, and
      she stated her reasons for the step she was taking without undue emphasis.
      In its severity and quiet determination the letter did not seem like her,
      and he suspected forgery, sisterly advice, paternal influence&mdash;a
      family conspiracy. There was but one thing to do. He looked through the
      various furniture for his hat; and with his head full of citations from
      the lives of artists illustrative of their conduct, he went to her. But
      Maggie would not see him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Brookes,&rdquo; the servant said, &ldquo;is in her room and cannot see you,
      sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will never be mine, she will never be mine,&rdquo; he muttered as he passed
      into the town. &ldquo;But why do I think she'll never be mine?&rdquo; And looking at
      the grey sea with only a trace of the sunset left in the grey sky he asked
      himself if the thought that had crossed his mind were a conviction, a
      fore-telling or merely a passing fancy created by the difficulty of the
      moment. He asked himself if he had heard himself saying, &ldquo;She'll never be
      mine&rdquo; and mistaken his own voice for the voice of Fate. Over the shingle
      bank the sea faded, a thin illusion, dim and promiseful of peace, and as
      the darkness and the sea filled Frank's soul he, the lightest and most
      life-loving of men, was filled for once with a sense of failure of life,
      and as his sorrowing thoughts drifted on he remembered that he had stood
      with her in hearing of the rising tide, and all his pleading and passion
      came back to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Willy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know. Maggie has broken off her engagement; she will never speak
      to me again, she hopes we may never meet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't understand. When did she break off her engagement?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frank told his story, and they walked across the green towards the studio.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you don't care. I don't believe you are listening to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am listening. You never think any one understands what is said to them
      if they do not instantly jump and call the stars to witness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I am like that&mdash;excitable&mdash;the difference between the
      Celt and the Saxon; and yet I don't know, your sisters are quite as
      excitable as I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They take after their mother; I am more like my father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wouldn't be a bad character for a play&mdash;a man who never would
      believe what you said, unless you threw up your arms and called on the
      stars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He can't be very bad if he can think about plays,&rdquo; thought Willy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, Willy, you won't offend me; tell me exactly what you think, did
      I do anything wrong? I swear to you there is nothing between me and Lizzie&mdash;I
      believe she is over head and ears in love with some fellow who has treated
      her very badly. She never would tell me who he was. In fact, she told me
      she had left London so that she might get over it. There would be no use
      my humbugging you, and I swear there is not, and never was, anything
      between me and Lizzie Baker. I never expected to see her again. It is very
      strange how people meet. I have told you all about it. When I go to
      Brighton I must go somewhere to get a drink, and I really don't see there
      is any harm in going to the 'Tivoli'; it didn't occur to me to think I
      should avoid the place merely because she was serving there. I have often
      been there, I don't deny it. Do you see there is any harm in my going
      there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't like giving an opinion unless I am fully acquainted with the
      facts; but it seems to me that you might have gone to the 'Tivoli' to have
      a drink without asking her to your studio.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay a bit, we'll speak of that presently. I am now telling you how I see
      Lizzie when I go to Brighton. I often go to Brighton by the four o'clock
      train, I often go to the 'Tivoli,' and when she is not talking to some one
      else I talk to her about things in general; but I swear I have never been
      out with her, that I never saw her except in the bar, and yet Maggie
      accuses me of keeping a woman in Brighton, and won't hear what I have to
      say in my defence. This is what she says: 'I have it on unquestionable
      authority that you have been keeping this woman since you returned from
      Ireland, perhaps before, and that you go in by the four o'clock train
      almost daily to see her.' Now I ask you if it is fair to make such
      accusations&mdash;such utterly false and baseless accusations&mdash;and
      then to refuse to hear what a fellow has to say in his defence? By Jove!
      if I caught the fellow who has been telling lies about me, I'd let him
      have it. Some of those Southdown Road people have been writing to her,
      that's about the long and short of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for having asked her to come to the studio, I assure you my intentions
      were quite innocent. Perhaps you won't understand what I mean; you don't
      care for painting, but very often an artist has a longing to paint a
      certain face, and the desire completely masters him. Well, I had a longing
      of this kind to paint Lizzie; hers is just the kind of head that suits me&mdash;she
      offered to give me a sitting, Idid not see much harm in accepting, and as
      I could not paint her in the bar-room, I asked her to the studio. But as
      for making out there was anything wrong&mdash;I assure you she is not that
      sort of girl. If we were married (I mean Maggie and I) I would have to
      have models; we'll have to come to an understanding on that point. Now
      what I want you to do is to explain to Maggie that there is nothing wrong
      between me and Lizzie, you can tell her there is nothing&mdash;I swear
      there is nothing; and then you had better explain that an artist must have
      models to work from.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't ask me. I wish you wouldn't ask me. I make a rule never to
      interfere in my sisters' affairs. I did once, you remember, and I thought
      I should never hear the end of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you might do this for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't ask me. I wish you wouldn't, my dear fellow. I am an exceedingly
      nervous chap, and I have had nothing but bad luck all my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think of nothing but yourself. You certainly are the most selfish
      fellow I ever met. You take no interest in any affairs but your own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Willy made no answer. He sat stroking his moustache softly with slow
      crumpled hand. After a long silence, he said: &ldquo;Tell me, Frank, are you
      really in love with my sister, or is it only imagination? I know people
      often think they are in love when their fancy is only a little excited.
      Very little will pass for being in love, but the real thing is very
      different from such fancies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you I never loved any one like Maggie. Yes, I am sure I love
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may be in love, I don't say you aren't; but I am sure there's no more
      common mistake than to fancy one's self in love because one's imagination
      is a bit excited. When you do fall in love, you find out your mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think no one was ever in love but yourself. Do you remember when you
      took me to see her, when we heard her sing 'Love was false as he was fair,
      and I loved him far too well'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frank knew no more of the story than that: Willy had loved this actress
      vainly. On occasions Willy had alluded to her, but he had never shown
      signs of wishing to confide.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I remember. How I loved that woman, and what a wreck it has made of
      my life. I daresay you often think me dull; I can quite understand your
      thinking me narrow-minded, selfish, and incapable of taking interest in
      other people's affairs: losing her took the soul out of my life. Now
      nothing really amuses me&mdash;now nothing really interests me. I often
      think if I were to die, it would be a happy release.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never told me anything about it before; wouldn't she marry you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never knew her. I fell in love with her the first time I saw her, and
      my love swallowed up everything else. Then I wasn't wrapped up in
      account-books, although I was always a precise and methodical sort of
      chap; I was young enough then, now I am an older man than my father. Some
      fellows have all the luck; everything succeeds with them, every one loves
      them, men and women, they get all they ask for and more, others get
      nothing. No matter what I tried to do, something went wrong and I was
      baulked. I set my heart on that girl, she was the one thing I wanted. I
      saw her play the same piece fifty times. I knew my passion was hopeless,
      but I couldn't resist it. Had I known her I might have won her, but there
      were no means; I never saw her but once off the stage, and that was but a
      moment. I often sent her presents, sometimes jewellery, sometimes fans or
      flowers, anything and everything I thought she would like. I sent her a
      beautiful locket; I paid fifty pounds for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did she accept your presents?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sent them anonymously.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you not try to make her acquaintance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew nobody in the theatrical world. I was not good at making
      acquaintances. You might have done it. I am a timid man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you make no attempt? You might have written.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last I did write.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you write?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tried to tell her the exact truth. I told her that I had refrained from
      writing to her for three years. That I quite understood the folly and the
      presumption of the effort; but I felt now, as drowning men that clutch at
      straws, that I must make my condition known to her. I told her I loved her
      truly and honourably, that my position and fortune would have entitled me
      to aspire to her hand if fate had been kind enough to allow me to know
      her. It was a very difficult letter to write, and I just tried to make
      myself clear. I told her I knew no one in the theatrical world, and that
      waiting and hoping for some chanceto bring us together would only result
      in misery long drawn out; that I had some faint hope that this letter
      might lead her to consider that there might be an exception to the rule
      that a young lady should not stop to speak to a young man she didn't know.
      I remember I said 'when men are in deadly earnest, truth seems to shine
      between the lines they write. I know I am in earnest, and may say that all
      I hold dear and precious in life is set in the hope that this letter may
      not appear to you in the light of one of those foolish and wicked letters
      which I believe men often write to actresses, and of which I suppose you
      have been the recipient.' Then I said that I would be at the stage door on
      the following night, and that I hoped she would allow me to speak a few
      words to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And did she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could not speak to her; I lost all courage in that moment. She walked
      close by me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean to say you did not speak to her after writing that letter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call me a fool, an idiot, what you will; I could not do it. I can only
      compare my feeling to what Livingstone says he felt when he found himself
      face to face with a lion. He stood staring in the lion's eyes, unable to
      move.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She must have thought your letter a practical joke. I wonder what she did
      think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wrote explaining the unfortunate circumstances as well as I could, and
      telling her I would come the following night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you speak to her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she wouldn't speak?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She passed on with her maid, but I didn't lose hope until she married. It
      was always a sort of sad pleasure to go to the theatre to see her. I used
      to live at the Manor House for two or three months at a time, saving up my
      money so as to be able to make her some nice present. I wished her to
      remember me, although she would not speak to me. No one came to the Manor
      House; there was nothing to do except to read the paper and smoke my pipe.
      I was sick of my life, and I counted the days that would have to pass till
      I saw her again&mdash;only thirty more days, only nineteen days, only one
      more week&mdash;so I used to count, marking off each day in an almanac,
      until one day I read the announcement of her marriage; then I knew all
      hope was at an end. I went mad that night and rushed out of the house, and
      I should have drowned myself had I not fainted. When I came to, I was weak
      and delirious, and wandered along the beach, not knowing where I was
      going. Some fishermen brought me home. My sisters were at school at the
      time. I believe I was very near dying. I fainted three times one
      afternoon. I used to lie on the sofa and cry for hours. She married a
      stockbroker. I believe she didn't care for him at all. Then she died. She
      was buried in Kensal Green. Whenever I am in London I go and see her
      grave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is awfully sad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; it ruined my life. I never had any luck. Things always went wrong
      with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to see those letters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't got copies. I didn't keep a letter-book in those days. Let's
      talk of something else. I have some news. I am going in for breeding
      race-horses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I say. I have calculated it all out, and I find I shall make from
      fifteen to twenty per cent, on my money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By breeding race-horses! And where are you going to breed them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know those stables on the Portslade Road where the veterinary surgeon
      used to live? I am going to take that place. The rent is three hundred
      pounds a year; there are fifty acres of pasture, and stabling for thirty
      horses. The dwelling-house is not a very aristocratic-looking place, but
      it will do for the present; when I begin to make money I shall go in for
      alterations. You can't do everything at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do astonish me. And where are you going to get the money to do all
      this? You will require at least twenty thousand pounds capital.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More than that. You would not be able to work a place like that under
      twenty-five thousand pounds,&rdquo; Willy replied sententiously. &ldquo;I have got
      about eight thousand left of my own, and I came in for a legacy of three
      thousand at the beginning of this year&mdash;an aunt of mine left me the
      money; and my father has agreed to let me have fourteen thousand on
      condition of my abandoning all further claim upon him. The bulk of his
      fortune will now be divided among my sisters. Berkins advised him to
      accept my offer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think so indeed; your father is worth ten thousand a year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, nothing like that. His business has been going down for years past.
      Last year he lost heavily again; if it weren't for his investments he
      wouldn't be able to go on with it. The business is done for; I knew that
      long ago. My father and I could never agree about how the accounts should
      be kept. That head clerk of his is an awful duffer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but what are you going to do with the shop?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The shop was the origin of it all. If it hadn't been for the shop I dare
      say I never should have thought of the race-horses. My father and I could
      never work together. I offered to buy his surplus fruit and vegetables,
      and, without absolutely binding myself to deal with no one else, I had
      assured him of my chief custom. Naturally I expected something in return&mdash;I
      expected him to let me have peaches in April and strawberries in March.
      You cannot do this without using a good deal of heating power. I spoke to
      the gardener several times. Often when I went into the houses I found the
      pipes nearly cold. I got tired of this, and I paid a man out of my own
      pocket to keep the furnaces properly stoked, and&mdash;would you believe
      it?&mdash;my father actually raised objections&mdash;objected to my paying
      a man to look after his glass-houses as they should be looked after. He
      said he would not order in any more coke, that I'd have to get along with
      what there was in the garden; he said he wished the shop at the devil. I
      saw it was hopeless. You cannot help my father, and he won't help himself,
      so I threw the whole thing up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when are you going to start the new scheme?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Immediately. One of my reasons for accepting fourteen thousand pounds
      down as a settlement in full was because I was beginning to fear that he
      might get wind of my marriage. From one or two things I have heard lately,
      I have reason to suspect that the secret is beginning to ooze out, and I
      thought it might be as well to take time by the forelock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you told him? What did he say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What people usually say when they criticise other people's lives without
      knowing anything of their temptations and sufferings. But I want to tell
      you about my scheme. I have bought Blue Mantle, the winner of the
      Czarewitch, and only beaten by a length for the Cambridgeshire, a
      three-year-old, with eight stone on his back; a most unlucky horse&mdash;if
      he had been in the Leger or Derby he would have won one or both. He broke
      down when he was four years old. By King Tom out of Merry Agnes, by
      Newminster out of Molly Bawn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't know you knew so much about racing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know more than you think. I don't let out all I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how much did you pay for Blue Mantle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dirt cheap. I can imagine myself two years hence, when my first batch of
      yearlings is put up for sale&mdash;500, 650, 800, 1000, knocked down for
      1000 guineas, brown colt by Blue Mantle out of Wild Rose, bred by William
      Brookes, Esq.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think money will come in quite so fast as that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not; but can't you let a fellow enjoy himself? I never knew any
      one like you for throwing cold water. I believe you are jealous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What nonsense!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, never mind. I shall be the deuce of a dog, see if I shan't. I
      always like to kill two birds with one stone if I can, and my business
      will bring me into connection with the very best in the land.
      Unfortunately! my people don't care about getting on; now I do. I like to
      know people who are better than myself&mdash;at all events, who are no
      worse. I shouldn't be surprised if I were dining at Goodwood and Arundel
      before long. When I go up to town I shall be calling on Lady This and Lady
      That, and later on I might get in somewhere in the Conservative interest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long you may know a man, and then find you are mistaken in his
      character,&rdquo; thought Frank. &ldquo;So vanity is at the bottom of all these
      efforts to make money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When are you coming to the Manor House?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible. You know I can't go there so long as your father&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in one afternoon; he'll ask you to stay to dinner. He has forgotten
      all about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot come to the Manor House until my engagement to your sister is
      sanctioned by him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The way to get that is to come to the Manor House and talk him into it.
      For my part, I think, even from his point of view, that it would be better
      that he should recognise the engagement; nothing can be more damaging than
      these clandestine meetings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can I do? I will not give her up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never interfere. I have quite enough worries of my own. I must be
      getting home. It is very late. Good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The green was as bright as day in the moonlight and Frank watched Willy
      walking, his shoulders thrown back. He sighed; an undefinable, but
      haunting melancholy hung about Willy; he often impressed Frank as an old
      book&mdash;a book whose text is trite&mdash;which no one will read, and
      which yet continues to make its mute appeal; a something that has always
      missed its way, that can hardly be said to be an adequate thing to offer
      for any man's money, that will soon disappear somehow out of all sight and
      reckoning.

    <p>
      A few days after he got a letter from Lizzie, saying she was alone and
      ill, and asking him to come and see her. He took the next train to
      Brighton. The land-lady's daughter, a girl of about twelve, opened the
      door to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is Miss Baker? Is she any better?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please, sir, she is not at all well, she has cold shivers; and mother
      went away yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who looks after Miss Baker?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please, sir, I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do! Is there no one else in the house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Miss Baker in bed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir. She said she would get up a little while this afternoon, 'cause
      she said she thought you was coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go and tell her I am here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please, sir, she said you was to go upstairs&mdash;the back room on the
      second floor, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so sorry you are ill, Lizzie. What is the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know; I think I caught a severe chill. I stayed out very late on
      the beach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why are you crying? Do tell me. Can I do anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No no. What does it matter whether I laugh or cry? Nothing matters now. I
      don't care what becomes of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A pretty girl like you; nonsense! Some one rich and grand will fall in
      love with you, and give you everything you want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want any one to fall in love with me; I am done for&mdash;don't
      care what becomes of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do tell me about it. Have you heard anything further about him? Do tell
      me; don't cry like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, leave me, leave me! I am so miserable. I don't know why I wrote
      to you. I hope I shall die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very lucky you did write to me, for you are clearly very ill. What
      is the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know; I can't get warm. This room is very cold&mdash;don't you
      think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cold? No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel cold; my throat is very bad&mdash;perhaps I shall be better in the
      morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must see a doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! I don't want to see a doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must see a doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, I beg of you. I only wrote to you because I was feeling so
      miserable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lizzie stood between him and the door, imploring him not to fetch a
      doctor, but to go away at once, and to tell no one she had written to him,
      or that he had been to see her. &ldquo;Nothing matters now&mdash;I am ruined&mdash;I
      don't care what becomes of me.&rdquo; He marvelled; but soon all considerations
      were swept away in anxiety for her bodily health; and having extorted a
      promise from her that she would not leave the room until he came back, he
      rushed to the nearest chemist and hence to the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to come at once, if possible, and see a young lady who, I
      fear, is dangerously ill. She has not been in Brighton long. She is quite
      alone. She sent for me. I live at Southwick. I came out at once. I have
      known her a long time. I may say she is a great friend of mine. I found
      her very ill&mdash;I must say her condition seems to me alarming. I should
      like her to see a doctor at once. Can you come at once?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am just finishing dinner. I will come in about ten minutes' time. What
      is the address?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;20 Preston Street.&mdash;I hope he does not think there is anything
      wrong,&rdquo; thought Frank. &ldquo;He look's as if he did,&rdquo; and with a view of
      removing suspicion, he said: &ldquo;She is a young lady whom I have known for
      some years. We had lost sight of each other until we travelled down in the
      train together. I say this because I do not wish you to think there is
      anything wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My good sir, I should not allow myself to have any opinions on the
      matter. I am summoned to attend a patient, and I give the best advice in
      my power.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but one can't help forming opinions&mdash;a beautiful young girl
      living alone in lodgings, and having apparently for sole protector a young
      man, are circumstances that might be easily misconstrued, and as I am
      engaged to be married, I think it right to tell you exactly how I stand in
      relation to this young woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you not think I did well in making this explanation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It can do no harm; we medical men see so much that we take no notice of
      anything but our patient. But tell me something of this young lady's
      suffering. Can you describe the symptoms?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has a racking headache&mdash;she is shivering all over&mdash;she sits
      by the fire and cannot get warm. It looks to me as if it were fever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does she complain of her throat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; she cannot swallow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably an attack of quinsy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that dangerous?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but it is infectious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't mind about that&mdash;she is alone. I will see her through it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go round to Preston Street immediately I have finished dinner&mdash;in
      about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the doctor had seen Lizzie, he said to Frank, who accompanied him
      downstairs: &ldquo;Just as I expected&mdash;quinsy. She will take from eight to
      ten days to get well. We have taken it in time, that's one good thing. The
      throat is very bad. She must have a linseed poultice, and she must use the
      gargle. Is there any one in the house who can attend to her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid not; the landlady went away this morning, leaving no one in
      the house but that child. She will, I hope, be home to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case you had better have a nurse in; I will give you the address
      of one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Frank returned he found her lying on the bed weeping. As before, she
      refused to tell him the cause of her grief. She would make no other answer
      than that nothing mattered now, that she didn't care what became of her;
      and when he spoke of going to fetch a nurse, she waved her hands
      excitedly, declaring she would on no consideration stop in the house with
      a woman she didn't know. And, hardly able to decide what course he should
      take, he promised not to leave her; she clung about him, and he was forced
      to send the child (whose name he now found to be Emma) to the chemist for
      the linseed, and he wrote a note asking for explicit directions how it
      should be used. Then he had to persuade Lizzie to go to bed. She resisted
      him, and it was with great difficulty that he got her boots and stockings
      off; then she collected her strength, unbuttoned her dress, and took off
      her stays. Then she said: &ldquo;Go out of the room for a moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He found his way into the kitchen, and guessing that hot water would be
      required, he lit a fire. But there was no muslin, and he had to send Emma
      for some. Lizzie smiled faintly when they entered&mdash;Frank with a
      basin, Emma with a kettle and a parcel of linen. Frank poured some rum
      into a glass, and beat an egg up with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; she asked; and her voice was so faint and hoarse that he
      turned, quite startled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something that will do your throat good and keep your strength up.
      Possibly you will not be able to eat much to-morrow.&rdquo; He held the tumbler
      to her lips, and at length succeeded in getting her to drink it. &ldquo;Emma, is
      the kettle boiling?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better go downstairs and get some coals, and if you can't find
      any nightlights you must go out and buy a box. Have you got any money
      over?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, sixpence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Lizzie, let me put this on your throat. Throw your head well back.
      There, it isn't too hot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And all that night he sat by her bedside. Often she could not get her
      breath, and he had to lift her and prop her up with pillows; and four
      times he lit the candle, and, with tired eyes, mixed the meal and placed
      it on her throat. The firelight played upon the ceiling, the kettle sang
      softly, the sufferer moaned, the light brought the rumble of a cart, and
      they awoke from shallow sleeps that blurred but did not extinguish
      consciousness of the actual present. &ldquo;You must not uncover yourself; you
      will catch cold. Let me pin this shawl about you.&rdquo; About eight o'clock
      Emma knocked at the door. Frank asked her to make him a cup of tea. The
      morning dragged along amid many anxieties, for he could see she was worse
      than she had been over night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The disease must take its course,&rdquo; said the doctor; &ldquo;we shall be
      fortunate if by poulticing we can stop it; if we can't, it will come to a
      head in about eight or nine days' time, and then it will break. Did you
      see the nurse last night? Couldn't she come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She,&rdquo; said Frank, pointing to the sufferer, &ldquo;wouldn't allow me to send
      for her; she said she would not stay in the house with a strange woman.
      She was very excited; I fancy she has had some great mental trouble&mdash;a
      sweetheart, I suppose. I did not like to cross her. I thought I could
      nurse her; I did my best. Was the poultice all right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right. But you will have to sit up with her to-night. You will be
      very tired; you had better get in a nurse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I shall be able to manage. The landlady is expected home this
      evening or to-morrow morning. What had she better have to eat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She won't be able to eat anything for some days. Try to get her to take
      an egg beat up in a wine-glass of rum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hourly she grew worse, and on the following day Frank stood by her bed
      momentarily fearing that she would suffocate; once her face blackened and
      he had to seize and lift her out of bed, and place her in a chair. When
      she seemed a little easier he called Emma, and they made the bed and
      cleaned up the room together. Then he ate a sausage and drank a glass of
      beer that had been brought from the public-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first night had seemed long and weary, but now the hours passed
      quickly; he had forgotten all but the suffering woman, and in the interest
      of inducing her to swallow some beef-tea, in the pride of such successes
      another and then another day fled lightly. Nor did he feel tired as he had
      done, and now a nap in an arm-chair seemed all that he required. So the
      landlady came as an unwelcome interruption of an absorbing occupation.
      Haggard and unshaven, he returned to Southwick, where he found a note on
      his table from General Horlock, asking him to dinner that evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know the meaning of this: Maggie will be there&mdash;a reconciliation!
      Can I?&rdquo; He turned his ear quickly from his conscience; he was frightened
      of the voice that would tell him that Maggie was nothing to him, never had
      been, never could be; that he had been born for Lizzie Baker, as the
      soldier is for the sword or the bullet that kills him; others had passed
      him, had been heard sharply, had gleamed dangerously in his eyes. They
      were but signs and omens meant for others, not for him, and they had
      passed. But this one had remained, though often lost, as that remains
      which is to be, and she was now no less for him than before, though now
      seemingly lost irrevocably to another; and in all the seeming of
      irrevocable loss was drawing nearer&mdash;not with the victory and destiny
      of old in her eyes, but with no less victory and destiny inherent in her.
      Though far from him, she had been for long a disintegrated influence, but
      what had been distant was now near, and all was yielding like a ship in
      the attraction of the fabulous loadstone mountain. That room!&mdash;the
      wash-hand-stand, the dirty panes of glass, the iron bed-there his fate had
      been sealed. That body which he had lifted out of bed still lay heavy in
      his arms. He still breathed the odour of the hair he had gathered from the
      pillow and striven to pin up; those eyes of limpid blue, pale as water
      where isles are sleeping, burned deep and livid in his soul; the touch and
      sight of that flesh, the sound of that voice, those tears, the solicitude
      and anxiety of those hours of night and day conspired against him, and his
      life was big with incipient overthrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lizzie was with him at all times. He saw her eyes, then her teeth, and the
      perfume and touch of her hair was often about him; and yet he was hardly
      conscious that a revolution of feeling was in progress within him; and
      when the time came for him to go to Horlock's he went there avoiding all
      thoughts of Maggie, although he knew he would be called upon that night to
      take a decisive step. He saw little of her before dinner, and during
      dinner the General's allusions to the quarrels of lovers being the renewal
      of love vexed him, and he thought, &ldquo;Confound it! If I want to make it up I
      will; but I am not going to be bullied into it.&rdquo; When the ladies left the
      room he found it difficult to pretend to the kind-hearted old soldier that
      he did not believe that Maggie would forgive him. &ldquo;Forgive me for what? I
      have done nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To get on with women you must always admit you are in the wrong&mdash;ha,
      ha, ha!&rdquo; laughed the General; &ldquo;now I have it from my wife&mdash;women know
      everything&mdash;ha, ha, ha!&rdquo; laughed the General. &ldquo;Have another glass of
      sherry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thanks; couldn't take any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I took I won't tell you how many glasses before I proposed to my wife,
      and then I was afraid; enough to make me&mdash;a clever woman like Mrs.
      Horlock, I believe you wouldn't find a woman in England like Mrs. Horlock.
      Look round; all that's her work. Look at that white Arab&mdash;exactly
      like him. I won five hundred pounds with that horse; but I wouldn't be
      satisfied, and I ran him again the following day and lost it all and five
      hundred more with it. I had another horse. My wife is modelling him in
      wax; she will show it to you in the next room. Marvellous woman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Passing Maggie by who was sitting in the window, Frank inveigled Mrs.
      Horlock into an anatomical discussion. The General stretched out his feet,
      put on his spectacles, and took up the <i>St James's</i>. The conversation
      dropped, and, full of apprehension and expecting reconciliation, Frank
      went to Maggie and talked to her of the tennis parties he was going to, of
      the people he had seen&mdash;of indifferent things. The time was tense
      with the fate of their lives. Once she turned her head and sighed. Time
      slipped by, and still they talked of their friends&mdash;of things they
      knew perfectly. Maggie said: &ldquo;I hope you are not angry; I hope we shall
      remain friends.&rdquo; Frank replied: &ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; and again the conversation
      paused. The General denounced Gladstone, and praised his wife's sculpture.
      Ten o'clock! Angel was lifted out of his basket. If Maggie had been Helen
      and Southwick Troy, he would not be kept waiting; the dogs had to be taken
      out; Willy came to fetch Maggie; hands were tendered, lips said good-bye,
      and, with a sense of parting, they parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feeling adrift and strangely alone, he walked to his lodging. His future
      loomed up in his mind as vague and as illusive as the village that now
      glared through the mist, white and phantasmal. He did not regret&mdash;we
      can hardly regret the impossible. Then, falling back on a piece of prose,
      he said: &ldquo;Where was the good? Mount Rorke would never have given his
      consent. Poor Lizzie; I hope she is better. I hope it has broken. She
      won't get any relief until it does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And next day, towards evening, he went to Brighton. He found her shrinking
      over the fire, wrapped in a woollen shawl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you to-day? You look a little better. I did not expect to find
      you out of bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am better, thank you; it broke yesterday, and I feel relieved. You are
      very good. I think I should have died if it had not been for you. Think of
      that landlady leaving me in the way she did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was the reason? Why did she rush off in that way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She went to town to see her sister, and she says she was taken ill. She
      drinks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does she? I hope she looked after you yesterday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As well as I did?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know about that; you are a very good nurse. It was very good of
      you; no one else would have done it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, not even <i>he</i>?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were with me for four days, and you never even went to bed&mdash;never
      took your clothes off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never even washed myself. By George! I was glad to get home and have a
      good wash. I was a sorry-looking object&mdash;haggard and unshaven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you say you had been to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody asked me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not Maggie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I didn't tell you our engagement is broken off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; you didn't say nothing about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On account of you. She discovered that you had been to my studio, and she
      said I was keeping a woman in Brighton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keeping a woman in Brighton&mdash;she thinks you are keeping me! I will
      write to her and tell her that it is not true. What right has she to say
      such things about me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She doesn't say it about you. She says a woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She means me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she doesn't; she doesn't know anything about you. Some one told her I
      went into Brighton every day by the four o'clock train, and she put two
      and two or rather two and three together, and said it was six.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I will write to her. I will not be the cause of any one's marriage
      being broken off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need not trouble. I saw her last night, and I could have made it all
      right had I chosen&mdash;she was quite willing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can't care for her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose not. I don't think I ever really loved her. I thought I did. I
      was mistaken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very changeable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don't think I am&mdash;at least not so far as you are concerned. I
      was mistaken. I was in love with some one else&mdash;with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, with you. I was in love with you when we went to Reading, and never
      got over it. I thought I had, but when love is real we never get over it.
      I always loved you, and those four days I spent nursing you have brought
      it all out. I shall never love any one else. I know you don't care for me;
      you said once you couldn't care for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I! I am too miserable to care for any one. I wish you had let me die; but
      that is ungrateful. You must excuse me, I am so miserable. Why speak of
      loving me? I can love no one. I don't care what becomes of me. I am
      ruined; nothing matters now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you would confide in me; you can trust me. Has he forsaken you?
      Can you not make it up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, never now; I shall never see him again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has anything happened lately, since you came to Brighton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lizzie nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't cry like that; tell me about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the use? Nothing matters now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he been here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lizzie nodded, and Frank folded the shawl about her, and wiped her tears
      away with his pocket handkerchief. &ldquo;Since you were ill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, before I was ill; he was down here watching me. He found out I had
      gone to your studio, and he said the most dreadful things&mdash;that he
      would break your head, and that I had never been true to him, and that I
      was not fit to be the wife of an honest man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I will tell him that you came to my studio to sit for your portrait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you mustn't write; it would only make matters worse. No use; he says
      he will never see me again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where can I see him? Has he gone back to London? I will follow him and
      tell him he is mistaken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, please don't, and please don't go to the 'Gaiety'; he is a violent-
      tempered man; something dreadful might occur. Please, promise me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not go to the 'Gaiety'? He doesn't know me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I seen him? Do tell me; you know you can trust me. I am your friend.
      Tell me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have seen him in the 'Gaiety,' in the grill-room&mdash;the waiter,
      number two, the good-looking tall man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wasn't always a waiter; his people are very superior. He has been
      unfortunate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it was he you loved this long while?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never cared for another man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must write and tell him he is committing an act of injustice. I will
      make this matter right for you, Lizzie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think you can?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rang for the landlady, and asked for writing materials. She apologised
      for the penny bottle of ink, and spoke of getting a table from the next
      room, but he said he could write very well on the chimney-piece. &ldquo;I
      suppose I had better begin, 'Sir'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't people generally begin, 'Dear Sir'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not when they don't know the people they are writing to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you do know him a little. He always said you were very haughty. You
      used to sit at his table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I had better begin the letter with 'Sir.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. You know best. He was always very jealous.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      XVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;SIR,&mdash;I hear from Miss Baker that you were in Brighton last week,
      and, drawing the inference from the fact that she came to my studio to sit
      for her portrait, you accuse her of very grievous impropriety. I beg to
      assure you that this is not so. At my urgent request, Miss Baker, whom I
      had better say I have known for some years, consented to give me a
      sitting. My intentions were purely artistic; hers were confined to a wish
      to oblige an old friend, and I deeply regret that they should have been
      misinterpreted, and I fear much unhappiness caused thereby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think that will do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is a beautiful letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think so&mdash;do you really think so? Do you think I have said
      all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might say something&mdash;that I never even kissed you; and that you
      respected me too much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will if you like, but don't you think that is implied?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps so; but you see he does not read many books. He hasn't time for
      much reading, and you put things in a difficult way. They sound beautiful,
      but I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Show me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, this 'grievous impropriety.' I know what you mean, but I couldn't
      explain it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I say 'serious impropriety'? but grievous is the right word. You
      say a grievous sin for a mortal sin. If we had done any wrong it would
      have been a grievous sin; but I'll change the word if you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, don't change it on my account; but I think he would understand an
      easier word better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A 'heinous impropriety'? No, that won't do. A 'serious impropriety.' That
      will do. Is there anything else you would like me to alter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don't think there is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think this letter will convince him that there was nothing wrong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so; but he is a very suspicious man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will post it when I go out.&rdquo; Then after a long silence: &ldquo;Do you know
      what time it is? It must be getting late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be getting on for nine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I must say good-bye; but I forgot, I want to ask you&mdash;you must
      be hard up, and want some money&mdash;do you? If you do, I assure you I
      shall be only too glad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I am rather hard up, for you know that this illness has prevented
      my doing anything; and I am afraid I have lost my place at the 'Tivoli.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you intend to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to go back to London. I shall see him there, and if the
      letter makes it right we may be married. I will write to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will?&mdash;Do. Here is five pounds. I have no more about me, but if
      anything should occur, you know where to write to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very good; I don't deserve it. I don't know why you take so much
      trouble about me. If he doesn't marry me I'll try to get another place; I
      shall go back to the firm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When do you intend to leave?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As soon as I am well enough, in a day or two; but you will not come here
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had thought that I might.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know; but if he were to hear that you had been here, it would be worse
      than ever. You don't mind, do you? You aren't angry, are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; good-bye, Lizzie. Write to me when you are married.&rdquo; Frank walked
      into the street. There was neither rage nor will in him. He was a
      sorrowing creature in a bitter world. The sea was cruelly blue in the
      coming night; the sky was also blue, only deeper, a red streak like a red
      bar of iron stretched across the embaying land, relieving into picturesque
      detail the outlines of coast-towns and villages. His eyes rested on and
      drew grief from this dim distance so illusive; and for jarring contrast,
      the pier hung with gaudy and gross decoration in the blue night, and a
      brass band replied to the waves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the clouds lifted, and when he returned to Southwick the moon was
      shining and some boys pursued the resounding ball through the shadows. He
      undressed with an effort, and he lay down hoping never to rise again. Next
      morning he went to his studio full of resolve. His picture must be
      finished for one of the winter exhibitions. He did not take up his
      palette, nor did he sit at his piano for more than a few minutes; and when
      he met Willy he raged against Lizzie, jeered at her vulgarity, heaped
      ridicule upon her lover, the waiter; he spoke of writing a novel on the
      subject; he set out her character at length; and was alarmed when told
      that Maggie was ill. He must win her. She must be his wife. So he told
      Willy, so he assured himself that she would. He knew that Lizzie was
      nothing to him. She had left Brighton, thank God! He went to sleep,
      certain he had torn this page out of his life, and he awoke to find it
      still there; and day after day he continued to brood upon, and still
      unable to understand its meaning, he longed to turn it over and read, for
      there were other pages; but they were sealed, and he might only read this
      one page.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid that our old friend Brookes is having a hard time of it,&rdquo; said
      the General, taking the spectacles from his nose, and laying down the <i>St
      James's</i>, &ldquo;they are all at him tooth and nail,&rdquo; and the General laughed
      gleefully. &ldquo;You are the young man who has upset them. The young lady won't
      dress herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Reggie, you shouldn't talk like that. I do hate to hear scandal;
      you'll repent it,&rdquo; said Mrs. Horlock, and she adroitly smoothed the wax on
      the horse's quarters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you, Mrs. Horlock, I never repeat what I hear; the guiding
      principle of my life is not to repeat conversations. Particularly in a
      village like Southwick, it is most essential that none of us should repeat
      conversations; I have always said that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do tell me about Maggie; I hear she is very ill. What is the matter with
      her? What did you say&mdash;the young lady won't dress herself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Reggie, I will not stay here and listen to scandal. Not a word of
      it is true, Mr. Escott.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is not true, Mrs. Horlock?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What he told you about her walking about the house with her hair down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think the General said anything about walking about the house
      with her hair down; he said some one wouldn't dress herself. I suppose he
      meant Maggie. I am sure I am sorry&mdash;I am most sorry&mdash;to hear she
      is ill, but it is unjust to assume that I had anything to do with her
      illness. We can speak freely among ourselves, you know. You know the
      circumstances; no one is more capable of understanding the case than you,
      for you are an artist. Maggie heard that I had had a model, that's what it
      amounts to, and she broke off the engagement; nothing could be more
      unjust, nothing could be more unwarranted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It could be brought on again, I know that,&rdquo; said Mrs. Horlock, and she
      turned the shoulders of her horse to the light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will not go into that question, Mrs. Horlock. I confine myself to what
      has happened, and I say I was treated unjustly, most shamefully; and when
      I have been cast aside like an old hat, I hear indirectly that it can be
      made up again. I have borne quite enough, and will bear no more. Old
      Brookes came down to my studio with that cad Berkins, and forced his way
      in, and then forbade me the house because my dog bit Berkins's thigh. I
      couldn't help it. What did he attack me for? He didn't suppose a bull-dog
      would be still while his master was being knocked on the head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What should a common City man know about dogs? He wouldn't sign the
      petition when I asked him, to Sir Charles Warren, to cancel the
      regulations about muzzling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then they set a report going that I had set the dog on, and if I
      hadn't set it on, that I hadn't called him off. As if I could! You know
      what a bull-dog is, Mrs. Horlock? Is a highly-bred dog likely to let go
      when he has fixed his teeth in the fleshy part of a thigh? The Brookes are
      old friends of mine, and I wouldn't say a word against them for the world;
      but of course it is as obvious to you as it is to me that they are not
      quite the thing. I mean&mdash;you know&mdash;I would not think of
      comparing them with the Southdown Road; but there is a little something.
      City people are not the Peerage; there's no use saying they are. Mount
      Rorke was upset; but I would not give in, and I think I should have won
      his consent in the long run. After all I have borne for her sake I think I
      might expect better treatment than to be thrown over, as I have said, like
      an old hat; and I don't mind telling you that I do not intend to be made a
      fool of in this matter; I shall turn a very deaf ear to stories of a
      broken heart and failing health. I shall not cease to think of Maggie. I
      loved her once very deeply, and I should have loved her always if&mdash;But
      tell me, General. You know I will not repeat anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I advise you to say no more, Reggie. I will not be mixed up in any
      scandal. I shall leave the room. Sally is dining here to-night; she is
      only too anxious to talk of her sister. If Mr. Escott will stay and take
      pot-luck with us, he will no doubt hear everything there is to hear in the
      course of the evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have we got for dinner, Ethel? I know we have got a leg of mutton,
      and there is some curry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your dinners are always excellent, Mrs. Horlock. I shall be delighted to
      stay. Here is Sally. Oh, how do you do, Sally? We were talking of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid every one is talking of me, now,&rdquo; she whispered, and the big
      girl passed over to Mrs. Horlock and kissed her. &ldquo;How is it that no one
      has seen anything of you lately?&rdquo; she said, taking the seat next him.
      &ldquo;What have you been doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing in particular. But I want to ask you about Maggie. I hear she is
      very ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Perceiving that his tone did not bespeak a loving mood, Sally's face
      brightened, and she became at once voluble and confidential.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we have been having no end of a time at home. Father has been
      speaking of selling the place and leaving Southwick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speaking of selling the place and leaving Southwick! And where does he
      think of going to live, and what is the reason of this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the reason! I suppose he would say I was the reason; and where heis
      going to live, that is not settled yet&mdash;probably one of the big
      London hotels. He says everybody is laughing at him, and that when he
      meets the young men at the station he can see them laughing at him over
      their newspapers, for, according to father, they have all flirted with us.
      Maggie has been saying all kinds of things against me, and I am afraid
      that the Southdown Road people have been writing him anonymous letters
      again. Some one&mdash;I don't know who it is&mdash;I wish I did&mdash;has
      been telling him the most shocking things about Jimmy Meason and me;
      things in which I assure you there is not a word of truth. You know
      yourself that we have hardly spoken for nearly two years; last year, it is
      true, we made it up a bit in your studio, but it didn't last long. I don't
      think I saw him twice afterwards, and never alone&mdash;and now to have
      everything that happened two years ago raked up and thrown in my face! I
      don't say I haven't&mdash;I don't know what you'd call it, I suppose you'd
      call it spooning. I admit I infinitely preferred walking about the garden
      with a young man to sitting in the drawing-room and doing woolwork. I was
      a silly little fool then, but I do think it hard that all this should be
      raked up now. I don't know what will happen. Maggie pretends to be
      frightened at me; 'tis only her nonsense to set father against me. She
      won't dress herself, and she walks about with her hair down her back,
      wringing her hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what does she say? This is very bewildering. I don't understand&mdash;I
      am quite lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is that Maggie doesn't know what she is saying, so I suppose I
      oughtn't to blame her. She is a little off her head, that's the truth of
      it; but you mustn't say I said so, it will get me into worse trouble than
      I am already in. She was like that once before, and had to be put in the
      charge of a lady who was in the habit of dealing with excitable people. I
      don't mean lunatics, don't run away with that notion. I don't know what
      would happen if it got about that I was putting that about. Maggie is very
      excitable, and she has been exciting herself a great deal lately&mdash;you
      were the principal cause. She did all she could to get you to make it up
      when you met her here at dinner&mdash;the dinner was given for that&mdash;but
      you said nothing about it, and she came home in an awful state, accusing
      every one of combining to ruin her. She said I was jealous of her, that I
      was wild with fear that she would one day be Lady Mount Rorke. She said
      father had done everything to break off her marriage, because he did not
      like parting with his money. She had set her heart on being married, and
      it was a terrible disappointment. She has been disappointed two or three
      times. Father doesn't know what to do. Her thoughts seem to run on that
      one subject. She walks about the garden saying the most extraordinary
      things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But tell me about the illness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know if I ought to tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know how to say it. She used to say she longed to become a
      mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Longed to become a mother? Well, that is the last thing&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know what I mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But tell me about the illness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should call it more than being a little excited, but of course she
      isn't mad. She has, however, the most curious notions. She is always a
      little too imaginative at the best of times; at least, I find her so, but
      now her delusions are really too absurd, and, as I have said, the worst of
      it is that her thoughts run on that one thing; it really is most
      unfortunate. Poor father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what are her delusions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I scarcely know how to tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try; anything can be told. It depends how it is told.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She thinks that the coachman has spread it all over Southwick&mdash;how
      shall I say it? I don't know that I ought to tell you. Well, that she has
      gone wrong with you and Berkins. I thought I should die of laughing&mdash;the
      idea of Berkins was too funny for words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your father doesn't believe it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He doesn't suspect me, I hope?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I am sure he doesn't. He knows Maggie doesn't know what she is
      saying. But he was dreadfully put out about Berkins; he is frightened out
      of his wits lest he should hear of it. But for goodness' sake don't
      mention that I said anything to you about it; I am in trouble enough as it
      is. Father says he can stand it no longer. I am very much afraid that he
      will leave Southwick. It depends on what Aunt Mary says. He has sent for
      her; she will be here to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These family councils were held in the billiard-room, and when Aunt Mary
      and Aunt Hester had had their tea they came along the passage, Aunt Mary
      of course in front, Aunt Hester timid and freckled and with her usual air
      of tracts. Uncle James stood with his back to the fire waiting for them.
      Willy caught at his hair, but an expression of resignation overspread his
      face, he packed his diary and accounts in brown paper and lit a pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, James, let us hear about these new troubles. Something must be done,
      that is clear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, something must be done, Mary, and I can think of nothing for it but
      to leave this place. It is no longer a place for me to live in. The
      Southdown Road has proved too strong for me, it has conquered me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't speak like that, James. We must try to bear our burdens, if not for
      our own sakes, for the sake of Him who died for us. He bore a very heavy
      cross for us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's no use in talking to me like that, Hester, you only provoke me.
      You forget what a cross two daughters are, and the Southdown Road has
      become intolerable. It is more than any man can bear; I will bear it no
      longer. I have borne it long enough, and am determined to get rid of it. I
      am afraid there's nothing for it but to sell the place and go and live in
      London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Hester cast her eyes into her satchel, afraid even to think that her
      brother had intentionally misinterpreted her words; but Aunt Mary laughed
      at the idea of the slonk-hill, as a latter-day Golgotha, with poor Uncle
      James staggering beneath the weight of the Southdown Road, young men and
      all, upon him. It was very irreverent. He burst into tears, Hester moved
      to leave the room, but was restrained by her sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My position is a most unfortunate one; since the death of poor Julia I
      have had no one to turn to, there has been no restraining influence in
      this house. Here am I working all day long in the City for those girls,
      and when I come home in the evening I find my house full of people I don't
      know. I assure you, Mary, I don't know any of the people who come to my
      house. I am consulted in nothing. It is not fair&mdash;I say it is not
      fair; and at my death those girls will have thirty thousand pounds
      a-piece.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew you had the money, James, I knew you had,&rdquo; exclaimed Aunt Mary,
      and even Aunt Hester could not help casting a look of admiration on her
      weeping brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say it is not fair; a man of my money should have a comfortable home to
      return to. Even the Southdown Road people have that; but no consideration
      is shown to me. My dinner is put back so that Sally may continue her
      flirtation with Meason in the slonk. Did any one ever hear of such a
      thing? A man's dinner put back so that&mdash;that&mdash;that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we know all about the dinner being put back; that was three years
      ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; Mr. Brookes asked himself, &ldquo;had he invited his sisters to his
      help?&rdquo; He was only adding bitterness to his bitter cup. &ldquo;You have no
      sympathy, Mary,&rdquo; he went on; &ldquo;you cannot understand the difficulties of my
      position&mdash;these two girls are for ever quarrelling and fighting;
      sometimes they are not even on speaking terms, but I think I prefer their
      sullen looks to their violence. Sally threatened to knock her sister down
      if she interfered with her young men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don't know if she has threatened to beat her lately. I don't
      remember when was the last time. Their various rows are all jumbled up in
      my head. All I know is that Maggie says she cannot live in the house with
      Sally. Maggie is very ill, she is in a very excited state, as she was once
      before, when I would not consent to her marriage with&mdash;I have
      forgotten his name, but it doesn't matter. Now she won't dress herself,
      and she walks about the house with her hair hanging down. I know there is
      nothing for it but to send her away under the charge of some lady who has
      had experience in such matters. She can't remain here. She has the
      strangest delusions. Among other things, she fancies the coachman has
      spread it all over Southwick that she has gone wrong with Berkins and that
      fellow Escott. Just fancy if Berkins&mdash;a ten thousand a year man&mdash;should
      hear of it! I don't know what he would say. He would peg into me; he is at
      times very hard indeed upon me. I don't say he is not a first-rate man of
      business, I know he has made several excellent investments; but for all
      that I do not and cannot think him competent to advise me on all my
      affairs, and that's what he is always doing. He talks of putting down that
      Southdown Road. I should like to see how he would set about doing it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;James, Maggie must go away; she is very highly organised, very sensitive,
      and if she were to remain here, Sally might have a real effect on her
      mind. It is clear the sisters don't get on together; have you had medical
      advice? I told you before that you should have medical advice about those
      girls; I told you to spare no expense, but to go to a first-rate London
      physician and take his opinion. I said before, and I say it again, that no
      girls in good health could carry on as dear Sally, and I will include dear
      Maggie; for although she does not defy you to the same extent, there is no
      doubt that she is too fast, too fond of young men; her thoughts run too
      much in that way, and now she is ill, of course she has delusions. You
      ought to have medical advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary, dear, the body is not everything; to cure the flesh you must first
      cure the soul. I believe our dear nieces rarely, if ever, attend church,
      rarely, if ever, remember that this life is not eternal and that there is
      a hereafter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The conversation came to a pause. Presently Aunt Mary asked Willy, who sat
      resigned to his fate, calm and solemn as a Buddha, his hands clasped over
      his rotund stomach, if he thought that Maggie's state was one to cause
      immediate anxiety, to which he replied: &ldquo;My sisters think of nothing but
      pleasure. The trouble girls are in a house is more than any one would
      believe. Here I am, I can do nothing; every night it is the same thing,
      over and over again.&rdquo; And the lean man lapsed into contemplation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But to come to the point, James, I want to hear about Sally. You said in
      your letter that a great deal had come to light, and that you now find
      that her conduct has been worse than you had ever imagined it, even in
      your moments of deepest dejection. Now, I want to hear about all this.
      What has she done? Let's have it in plain English. What has she done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To put it plainly, Mary,&rdquo; said Mr. Brookes, wiping his tears away, and
      turning his back upon his Goodall, &ldquo;I don't know what she hasn't done&mdash;everything.
      She is at the present moment the talk of Southwick. The doctor here has
      seen her in the field at the back here with Meason at nine o'clock at
      night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you allow her to leave the house at that hour? No young girl&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She always takes her dogs out in the evening; I cannot prevent her doing
      that. It appears, too, that she has had Meason up in her bedroom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O James, you do not mean to say that my dear niece had a man in her
      bedroom!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hester, dear, you have lived in a rectory and know nothing of the world.
      She says it isn't a bedroom. She pushes the bed away in the daytime, and
      covers it up to make it look like a couch. Besides, she keeps birds in her
      room, and Flossy had her puppies there. I am not excusing her conduct,
      pray do not think that, I am only telling you what she says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is very serious. Are you quite sure? Perhaps she only meant to show
      the young man her birds or puppies. Her spirit must be broken, I can
      clearly see that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I allow them, as you know, one hundred pounds a year apiece. Maggie keeps
      none, but Sally always keeps accurate accounts of what she spends. I asked
      to see those accounts, for I had heard she had been giving her money to
      Meason, and she refused to let me see them. There is a sum of twenty
      pounds for which she can give no explanation. Then it is well known she
      gave a set of diamond studs to that fellow, and that he pledged them for
      five pounds in Brighton. He boasted he had done so, and said he intended
      to get plenty of money out of me before he had done with me. After that I
      ask you, how can I live in this place? When I go to the station in the
      morning I see these young fellows laughing at me over the tops of their
      newspapers. When I come home of an evening after a hard day's work, I find
      that my dinner&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her spirit must be broken,&rdquo; said Aunt Mary, drawing her shawl about her,
      and crossing her hands. &ldquo;Her spirit must be broken; she cannot be allowed
      to remain here to drive dear Maggie into a lunatic asylum. I am with you
      in that, James, but I cannot think you did well to let Frank Escott slip
      through your fingers. Had you not talked so much about money your daughter
      might have been Lady Mount Rorke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talked too much about my money? Who would talk about it, I should like to
      know, if I didn't? I made it all myself. What do I care for that lot&mdash;a
      stuck-up lot, pooh, pooh! twist them all round my finger. I am not going
      to give my daughter to a man who cannot make a settlement upon her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seeing he was not to be moved in anything that concerned his pocket, Aunt
      Mary returned to the consideration of what was to be done with Sally.
      &ldquo;From what you tell me it is clear that Sally must not remain in Southwick
      a day longer than can be helped. I will take her with me to Woburn; and I
      think she had better go abroad as soon as we can hear of some one in whose
      charge we can place her. But it must not be a sea voyage&mdash;there is
      nothing more dangerous than to be on board a ship for a young girl who is
      at all inclined to be fast. All are thrown so much together. The cabins
      open out one into the other, and there is always a looking for something&mdash;a
      handkerchief, a bunch of keys, a lot of stooping and playing, twiddling of
      moustaches,&rdquo; said Aunt Mary, with a peal of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary, dear, we should not speak lightly of wickedness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was so that all the mischief was done when Emily Evans was sent out to
      the Cape&mdash;it was all done on board a ship. You remember the Evanses,
      James?&mdash;you ought to, you used to flirt pretty desperately with Lucy,
      the younger sister.&rdquo; And then Aunt Mary rattled off into interminable
      tales concerning the attachment contracted on board a ship in particular,
      its unfortunate consequences, how it brought about a divorce later on by
      sowing the seeds of passion (Aunt Mary always pronounced the word
      &ldquo;passion&rdquo; in her narratives with strong emphasis), in the young girl's
      heart; and at various stages of her discourse she introduced fragments of
      the family history of the Evanses; she followed the wanderings of the
      different sisters from Homburg to Paris, from Paris to Scotland, from
      Scotland to the Punjab, explaining their different temperaments by
      heredity, which led her back into the obscure and remote times of
      grandfathers and grandmothers, and, having finally lost herself, she said:
      &ldquo;What was I talking about? You have been listening to me, James, what was
      I talking about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Till the end of a week the discussion was continued. Aunt Mary tried hard
      to reconcile all parties to their different lots, and, as is usual in such
      cases, without attaining any result. And yet Aunt Mary went with her
      sister to see Frank in his studio. Willy accompanied them, and when they
      left he complained bitterly of how his time was wasted. &ldquo;Regularly every
      evening, just as I am sitting down to work, I hear them coming along the
      passage. First of all they go to get their grog&mdash;squeak, squeak, pop.
      I know it all so well. Then they come in with their tumblers, and they sit
      down on the sofa, and they begin.&mdash;I don't know what is to be done
      with dear Sally, unless we can send her abroad in the care of some
      relation. How is dear Maggie to-day? I hope I shall be able to induce her
      to put on her frock to-morrow, and come for a drive with me in the
      carriage. What a trouble young girls are in the house, to be sure. Then
      father begins to groan, and pulls out his handkerchief; he is quite alone,
      he has no one he can depend upon, then he laughs, 'Well, well, I suppose
      it will be all the same a hundred years hence.' So it goes on night after
      night. Here am I starting a big business, and I haven't a room to work in.
      Just as I am adding up a long column of figures, perhaps when I am within
      three of the top, Aunt Mary asks me a question, and it has to be gone over
      again. It is most provoking, there's no denying that it is most
      provoking.&rdquo; Frank agreed that nothing could be more provoking than to be
      interrupted when you were within three of the top of a long column of
      figures. On the following day he heard that the aunts had left, taking
      Sally with them. They had promised their brother to find a lady who would
      take dear Maggie under her care&mdash;one who would soon wean her from
      dressing-gowns and delusions, and restore her to staid remarks and stays;
      and hopes were entertained that the Manor House would not have to be sold
      after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      But many days had not sped when an event occurred that precipitated the
      five acres into the jaws of the builders. Meason had sailed for Melbourne,
      and his sister, thinking that some of Sally's letters might be of use to
      Mr. Brookes, offered to surrender them upon the receipt of a cheque for
      one hundred pounds&mdash;a very modest sum, she urged, considering the
      character of the letters, most of which concerned artfully laid plans to
      meet in the train going or coming from London. Mr. Brookes called on the
      shade of dear Julia, but he was not a man to be blackmailed&mdash;he had
      made all his money himself, and on that point was immovable. He prepared
      to leave Southwick. He looked fondly on his glass-houses, and despairingly
      on his Friths, Goodalls, and Bouguereaus, and he wondered if they would
      look as well in the new rooms as in the old, and what sum they would
      realise if he were to include them in the auction; for an auction was
      necessary. Mr. Brookes did not thus decide to abandon his acres without
      many a sob, nor is it certain that the final step would have been taken if
      the gentle builder had not gilded his insidious hand, and if certain
      rumours were not about that the villas in the Southdown Road were not
      letting, and that Southwick would never be anything but what it was, a
      dirty little village&mdash;half suburb, half village.

    </h2>
    <p>
      Frank was grieved and troubled at the sad accounts that came to him of
      Maggie's health; he was perplexed, too, for he knew himself to be the
      cause, and he longed to relieve and to cure her. It seemed to him that he
      would give his life to go to her, and comfort her with love, and yet he
      was impotent to make the least effort to attain the end he desired. He lay
      in the sad and cruel memory of Lizzie, his mind filled with ignoble
      visions of her life with the waiter, or with delicate fancies of her
      beauty amid the summer of the Thames. He mused on her gracious figure and
      face, illuminated by reflections from the water, set off by the bulrushes
      and floating blossoms which she so eagerly coveted, and varied by the
      movements of the waist and shoulders, the round white arm, the trailing
      scarf, and all the wistful charm of the slumbering evening. He thought of
      the country light, the sound and smell of cows, of the sparrows in the
      vine, the cottage looking so cosy amid the foliage, the bit of garden full
      of old-fashioned flowers, tall lilies, convolvuluses, and marigolds, and
      the sitting-room full of things belonging to her&mdash;her flowers, her
      books, her music, and he thought of this until his life was sick with
      desire, and there grew a burning pain about his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man's struggles in the web of a vile love are as pitiful as those of a
      fly in the meshes of the spider; he crawls to the edge, but only to
      ensnare himself more completely; he takes pleasure in ridiculing her, but
      whether he praises or blames, she remains mistress of his life; all
      threads are equally fatal, and each that should have served to bear him
      out of the trap only goes to bind him faster. A man in love suggests the
      spider's web, and when he is seeking to escape from a woman that will
      degrade his life, the cruelty which is added completes and perfects the
      comparison. A man's love for a common woman is as a fire in his vitals;
      sometimes it seems quenched, sometimes it is torn out by angry hands, but
      always some spark remains; it contrives to unite about its victim, and in
      the end has its way. It is a cancerous disease, but it cannot be cut out
      like a cancer. It is more deadly; it is inexplicable. All good things,
      wealth and honour, are forfeited for it; long years of toil, trouble,
      privation of all kinds, are willingly accepted; on one side all the
      sweetness of the world, on the other nothing of worth, often vice,
      meanness, ill-temper, all that go to make life a madness and a terror;
      twenty, thirty, forty, perhaps fifty years lie a head of him and her, but
      the years and their burdens are not for his eyes any more than the flowers
      he elects to disdain. Love is blind, but sometimes there is no love. How
      then shall we explain this inexplicable mystery; wonderful riddle that
      none shall explain and that every generation propounds?
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank lingered in Southwick, for he had promised Willy to stay with him
      when he went to live at the stables on the Portslade Road. Summer was
      nearly over, hunting would soon commence, and he could keep a couple of
      hunters&mdash;Willy had calculated it out&mdash;for two and twenty
      shillings a week. He had ceased to paint, and when he went to the studio
      it was to play the piano or the violin. None knew of Lizzie, and all knew
      of Maggie. It was thought a little strange that he would not forgive her,
      but the obscurity of the story of this point and the delight felt in her
      misfortune helped to intensify and idealise Frank in the popular mind, and
      when he played Gounod in the still evenings the young ladies would steal
      from the villas and wander sentimentally through the shadows about the
      green. He got up late in the morning, he lingered over breakfast, and
      until it was time to go to Brighton he lay on the sofa watching the
      cricketers and the children playing, shaping resolutions, and striving
      with himself and deceiving himself. A dozen times, a hundred times, he had
      concluded he must see Maggie; he had decided he would write to Lord Mount
      Rorke, that he would go to Mr. Brookes and settle the matter off-hand.
      But, somehow, he did nothing. His mind was absorbed in a novel, which he
      narrated when Willy came to see him. It concerned the accident that led a
      man not to marry the woman he loved, and was in the main an incoherent
      version of his own life at Southwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think I told you,&rdquo; said Willy, &ldquo;that they are removing the
      furniture to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't say so&mdash;to-day? And where is your father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is in London, at the 'Metropole.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young men walked on slowly in silence, and when they came to the lodge
      gate, standing wide open, and saw the curtainless windows and the
      flowerless greenhouses, Willy said: &ldquo;It is very sad to see all the things
      you have known since you were a child sold by auction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, it is. Look at the swards. Do they not look sad already? Those
      beautiful elms, under whose shade we have sat, will be cut down, and
      stucco work and glass porticoes take their places. Oh, it is very sad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father never had any feeling, he never cared for the place. Had I been
      in his place I should have invested my money in land and gone in for the
      county families.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How old was I when I came down to see you for the first time&mdash;fourteen,
      I think? How well I remember everything. It was there, look, through that
      glade, that I saw your sisters coming to meet me, they were then only ten
      or eleven years old. I can see them in my mind's eye, quite distinctly,
      walking towards me, Grace leading the way, and now she is a mother; and
      they were all so dark. I remember thinking I had never seen girls so dark,
      they were like foreigners. And do you remember how your father scolded
      Sally for carrying me round the garden on her back, and she used to wake
      me up in the mornings by rolling croquet balls along the floor into my
      room. Oh, what good, dear days those were, and to think they are dead and
      gone, and that the house is going to be pulled down; and the garden&mdash;oh!
      the moonlights in that garden, where I walked with the girls, with scarves
      round their shoulders, through the dreamy light and shade. We have sung
      songs, and talked of all manner of things. You don't feel as I feel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes I do, my dear fellow, I think I feel a great deal more, only I don't
      talk so much about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it is infinitely sad. This dear old wall! There is Maggie's
      window: how often have I looked up to that window for her winsome face,
      and I shall never look again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are as bad as my father. Cheer up; I suppose it will be all the same
      a hundred years hence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, it won't be the same. Why should all I feel and love be
      forgotten. I suppose it will be all the same. There goes Berkins. I hate
      that man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So do I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If time takes away pleasant things it takes unpleasant things too, and
      those who live a hundred years hence will not be troubled with that fool.
      True, there will be other Berkinses, and there will be other gardens, and
      other girls, but that doesn't make it the least less sad to see this
      garden pass into bricks and mortar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two footmen approached Mr. Berkins, and with all solemnity helped him to
      take off his overcoat. He said a few words to Willy, and was soon loudly
      ordering the workmen who were taking the Goodalls and the Friths from the
      walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care, there! Hi, you! get on the ladder and take hold of this end of
      the picture. There, that's better! That's the way to do it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what he said when he shot my bird,&rdquo; Willy whispered; and they
      tried to laugh as they went upstairs. But their footsteps sounded hollow,
      and the wardrobes, where they had so often put their clothes, stood wide
      open, desolately empty. They looked out of the windows, and heard the
      voices of the work-people.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How very sad it is,&rdquo; said Frank; then, after a long silence: &ldquo;How
      beautiful a scene like this would be in a book&mdash;a young girl leaving
      her home, straying through the different rooms musing on the different
      pieces of furniture, all of which recall the past. I think I shall write
      it. I wish you would tell me what you feel; I mean, I wish you would tell
      me what impresses itself most on your mind, and, as it were, epitomises
      the whole. You have known all this since you were a child. You have played
      in these passages; some spot, some piece of furniture, your toys&mdash;I
      suppose they are gone long ago; but something must stand out and assert
      itself amid conflicting thoughts. Do tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Willy stroked his moustache. &ldquo;Of course it is very sad, but it is
      difficult to put one's feelings into words. I should have to think about
      it; I don't think I could say off-hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment there came a great crash.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the devil is that?&rdquo; cried Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope they haven't broken the statue of Flora,&rdquo; said Willy, and a look
      of alarm overspread his face. Frank felt that if such were the case he
      should feel no great sorrow. They ran down the echoing stairs. The workmen
      had got drunk in the cellars and in removing the statue they had let it
      fall, and it strewed the floor&mdash;an arm here, a fragment of drapery
      there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew what would happen. I told Mr. Brookes so. All my statues are in
      marble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come away, I can't listen to that cad. I wouldn't have had Flora broken
      for a hundred pounds. When I was a child I used to stand and look at her.
      I never could make out how she was made, and I always wanted to look
      inside. If you'd like to know what I feel most sorry for, it is Flora. She
      has stood amid the flowers in the bow window as long as I can remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They followed the high road by Windmill Inn, where they struck across the
      Downs, and when they reached the first crest they could see the paddocks
      and enclosures situated along the road in the valley, and the private
      house so trim and middle-class. &ldquo;Splendid paddocks and first-rate
      stabling. The house is not much. When I am making fifteen per cent. on my
      money I shall go in for a little architecture. If I had a glass I could
      show you Blue Mantle's stable. Do you see two horses in the paddock, right
      away on the left, in the far corner&mdash;Apple Blossom and Astarte? Apple
      Blossom is by See-saw out of Melody, by Stockwell out of Fairy Queen. Is
      that good enough for you? Astarte is by Blue Gown out of Merry Maid, by
      Beadsman out of Aurora. What do you say to that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see you have been looking up the Stud Book.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Business, sir, business. And if I were to go in for owning a racer or
      two, just look and see what a magnificent training ground; miles upon
      miles of downland. Did you ever see a handsomer view? You must paint me
      some landscapes for my dining-room.&rdquo;

    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The pain is always here&mdash;just over the heart. You know what I mean?
      Suddenly, when I am thinking of other things, the sound of her voice and
      the sight of her face comes upon me, and then a dead, weary ache. I know I
      cannot have her, perhaps if I did I shouldn't be wholly glad; but glad or
      sorry, good fortune or ill, I cannot forget her. My life will not be
      complete. You have felt all this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind how I felt, you know I don't like talking about it. I am sorry
      for you. We all have our troubles, I've had nothing else; I often think
      that if I were to die to-morrow it would be a happy release.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had never seen her, or if I had married Maggie; if your father had
      not put obstacles in the way; if he had not raised the wretched money
      question, which you know as well as I do was dragged in quite
      unnecessarily, I should not be suffering now. For, once married, I should
      think of no one but my wife. I am sure I should make a good husband. I
      know I could make a woman happy; she'll never find a husband better than
      she'd have found in me, I don't believe if they were to be made that you
      could make a better husband than I should be&mdash;I feel it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have always said that my father brings all his troubles on himself. He
      never went in for the country people; he never would have people at the
      Manor House. You can't shut up young girls as if they were in a convent,
      and if they don't get the right people they'll have the wrong people. My
      father thinks of nothing but his money, and he can't understand that he
      might go for an equivalent. How could he have expected it to have turned
      in your case but as it did? Lord Mount Rorke was not going to come over to
      Southwick to haggle over pounds, shillings, and pence with him&mdash;not
      likely. My sisters might have married very well if he had gone the right
      way to work, and he would have been saved a deal of worry and bother. I
      always say that my father brings all his troubles on himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far as I was concerned he certainly acted very stupidly. Ah, if I had
      married Maggie last summer, how different my life would be now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you couldn't have really loved her; if you had you would never&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I did love her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard from my father to-day. Maggie is better. This is, of course, a
      very delicate question, but we have been friends so long&mdash;would you
      like me to see if&mdash;if this matter could be arranged? I don't like, as
      you know, to meddle in other people's affairs, I have quite enough to do
      to look after my own; but if you would like&mdash;You, of course, do not
      think of marrying Lizzie Baker?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you would like me to speak to my father? Are you willing? Would you
      like to marry Maggie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, of course I should.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't say so because she is my sister, but I think it is the best thing
      you could do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had traversed the paddock, and were close to the stables. Picking a
      few carrots out of a heap, they opened the door of Blue Mantle's box. The
      horse came towards them, his large eyes glancing, his beautiful crest
      arched. His coat shone like satin, his legs were as fine as steel, and
      with exquisite relish he drew the carrots from their hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The perspective of the hills was prolonged upon fading tints, and in the
      pale blueness the mares feeding in the paddocks grew strangely solitary
      and distinct; the trees about the coast towns were blended in shadow, and
      out of the first stars fell a quiet peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their dinner awaited them&mdash;a little dinner, simple and humble. After
      dinner, when the lamp was brought in, Willy nursed the missus with
      affection and sincerity. Cissy sat on Frank's knee, and he told her
      stories and stroked her hair. This household retired at eleven. At ten
      every morning Willy was busy with his letters, his cheques, his accounts,
      and in the afternoon the young men walked about the fields talking of
      possible successes of the forthcoming breeding season, and so the days
      went. But the secret forces were busy about Frank's life. There were mines
      and counter-mines. Every fort of prejudice, every citadel of reason rested
      now upon foundations that quaked, and would fall at the first shock. Doom
      was about him. As the silence rustles in the deadly hush of the storm that
      brings winter upon the forest, he waited unconscious as a leaf in the
      imminence of the autumn moment; and in such a stillness, awaiting a change
      of soul, he received a letter from Lizzie. It dropped from his hand, and
      such desire to go as comes on swallow and cuckoo came on him; he struggled
      for a moment, and was sucked down in his passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little village&mdash;a summary of English life and custom, a symbol of
      the Saxon, the church steeple pointing through the elm trees, the villas
      with their various embellishment in the line of glass porticos and privet
      hedges, the General, Mrs. Horlick, Messrs Brookes and Berkins&mdash;how
      complete it seemed, how individual and how synthetical&mdash;his eyes
      filled with tears of unpremeditated grief. The leaves were falling, the
      hills were shrouded in wreaths of floating mist. Some trees had been cut
      down and scaffolding had been reared about the Manor House, some of the
      walls had already fallen revealing the wall paper, the pattern of which he
      could almost distinguish. He was going to the woman he loved, but he was
      leaving his youth behind, and those whom he had known as children, as
      girls, as women; he remembered all the gossip, all the quarrels, all the
      to-do about nothing; and now, looking on the beautiful garden where he had
      played and passioned in all varying moments of grief and glee, he re-lived
      the past; and leaning out of the carriage window he gazed fondly, and
      cried out: &ldquo;Alas, those were Spring Days.&rdquo;

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
