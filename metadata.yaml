description: This novel (1888) tells the story of three spoiled daughters who are
  a great source of grief and distress to their parents. Moore later called the book
  the worst book he'd ever written, and it was omitted from the lists of his acknowledged
  works. Twenty-five years later, however, at the urging of friends with whom the
  book found favor, Moore revisited the work, and deemed it more engaging than he'd
  remembered.
